When two charged particles are released from rest, they will experience a force due to the electric field. This force will cause them to accelerate. 

The direction of the force will depend on the sign of the charge of the particles. If the charges are the same, the particles will experience a repulsive force and will accelerate away from each other. If the charges are opposite, the particles will experience an attractive force and will accelerate towards each other.

First, we need to calculate the concentration of the acid in the solution. We can do this by using the molar mass of the acid and the amount of acid that was dissolved in the solution. 

Molar mass of acid = 248 g/mol
Amount of acid = 0.0050 mol

Concentration of acid = 0.0050 mol/0.500 L = 0.01 mol/L

Now, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to calculate the pKa of the acid. 

pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])

3.89 = pKa + log(0.01/[HA])

pKa = 3.89 - log(0.01/[HA])

pKa = 3.89 - (-2.00)

pKa = 5.89

The great majority of wealthy children would follow these plebeian tastes, if civilized education did not oppose the development of them; and if the filthiness of the workshops and the coarseness of the workmen did not arouse a repugnance stronger than the attraction.

Lenin believed that the situation was critical and that to delay the uprising would be fatal. He urged comrades to mobilize and send delegations to the Revolutionary Military Committee and the Central Committee of the Bolsheviks with the demand that power should not be left in the hands of Kerensky.

The revolutionary seed had penetrated into every country and spread more or less. It was greatly developed under the régime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.
The monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.
Union between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .
Let them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.
Let them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.
Let them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.

Of the 450 sick persons whom the inhabitants were unable to relieve, 200 were turned out, and these we saw die one by one as they lay on the roadside. A large number still remain, and to each of them it is only possible to dole out the least scrap of bread. We only give bread to those who would otherwise die. The staple dish here consists of mice, which the inhabitants hunt, so desperate are they from hunger. They devour roots which the animals cannot eat; one can, in fact, not put into words the things one sees. . . . This narrative, far from exaggerating, rather understates the horror of the case, for it does not record the hundredth part of the misery in this district. Those who have not witnessed it with their own eyes cannot imagine how great it is. Not a day passes but at least 200 people die of famine in the two provinces. We certify to having ourselves seen herds, not of cattle, but of men and women, wandering about the fields between Rheims and Rhétel, turning up the earth like pigs to find a few roots; and as they can only find rotten ones, and not half enough of them, they become so weak that they have not strength left to seek food. The parish priest at Boult, whose letter we enclose, tells us he has buried three of his parishioners who died of hunger. The rest subsisted on chopped straw mixed with earth, of which they composed a food which cannot be called bread. Other persons in the same place lived on the bodies of animals which had died of disease, and which the curé, otherwise unable to help his people, allowed them to roast at the presbytery fire.

""In 1500 that work appeared which Erasmus had written after his misfortune at Dover, and had dedicated to Mountjoy, the Adagiorum Collectanea. It was a collection of about eight hundred proverbial sayings drawn from the Latin authors of antiquity and elucidated for the use of those who aspired to write an elegant Latin style. In the dedication Erasmus pointed out the profit an author may derive, both in ornamenting his style and in strengthening his argumentation, from having at his disposal a good supply of sentences hallowed by their antiquity. He proposes to offer such a help to his readers. What he actually gave was much more. He familiarized a much wider circle than the earlier humanists had reached with the spirit of antiquity.
Until this time the humanists had, to some extent, monopolized the treasures of classic culture, in order to parade their knowledge of which the multitude remained destitute, and so to become strange prodigies of learning and elegance. With his irresistible need of teaching and his sincere love for humanity and its general culture, Erasmus introduced the classic spirit, in so far as it could be reflected in the soul of a sixteenth-century Christian, among the people. Not he alone; but none more extensively and more effectively. Not among all the people, it is true, for by writing in Latin he limited his direct influence to the educated classes, which in those days were the upper classes.
Erasmus made current the classic spirit. Humanism ceased to be the exclusive privilege of a few. According to Beatus Rhenanus he had been reproached by some humanists, when about to publish the Adagia, for divulging the mysteries of their craft. But he desired that the book of antiquity should be open to all.""

What shall I say concerning its mastery of and its waste of mechanical power, its commonwealth so poor, its enemies of the commonwealth so rich, its stupendous organization—for the misery of life! Its contempt of simple pleasures which everyone could enjoy but for its folly? Its eyeless vulgarity which has destroyed art, the one certain solace of labor?

If we need to be recalled to the origin of election, to prove that we obtain salvation from no other source than the mere goodness of God, they who desire to extinguish this principle, do all they can to obscure what ought to be magnificently and loudly celebrated, and to pluck up humility by the roots. In ascribing the salvation of the remnant of the people to the election of grace, Paul clearly testifies, that it is then only known that God saves whom upon which there can be no claim. They who shut the gates to prevent anyone from presuming to approach and taste this doctrine, do no less injury to man than to God; for nothing else will be sufficient to produce in us suitable humility, or to impress us with a due sense of our great obligations to God. Nor is there any other basis for solid confidence, even according to the authority of Christ, who, to deliver us from all fear, and render us invincible amidst so many dangers, snares, and deadly conflicts, promises to preserve in safety all whom the Father has committed to His care.

As with a Commander of the Army, or leader of any enterprise, so it is with the mistress of the house. Her spirit will be seen through the whole establishment; and just in proportion as she performs her duties intelligently and thoroughly, so will her domestics follow in her path. Of all of those acquirements, which more particularly belong to the feminine character, there are none which take a higher rank, in our estimation, than such as enter into a knowledge of household duties; for on these are perpetually dependent the happiness, comfort, and well-being of the family.

The following excerpt is from a pamphlet.
You will do me the justice to remember, that I have always strenuously supported the Right of every man to his own opinion, however different that opinion might be to mine. He who denies to another this right, makes a slave of himself to his present opinion, because he precludes himself the right of changing it.
The most formidable weapon against errors of every kind is Reason. I have never used any other, and I trust I never shall.
The circumstance that has now taken place in France of the total abolition of the whole national order of priesthood, and of everything appertaining to compulsive systems of religion, and compulsive articles of faith, has not only precipitated my intention, but rendered a work of this kind exceedingly necessary, lest in the general wreck of superstition, of false systems of government, and false theology, we lose sight of morality, of humanity, and of the theology that is true.
I believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life.
I believe in the equality of man; and I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make our fellow-creatures happy.
I do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of. My own mind is my own church.
All national institutions of churches, whether Jewish, Christian or Turkish, appear to me no other than human inventions, set up to terrify and enslave mankind, and monopolize power and profit.
I do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise; they have the same right to their belief as I have to mine.

The revolutionary seed had penetrated into every country and spread more or less. It was greatly developed under the régime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.
The monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.
Union between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .
Let them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.
Let them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.
Let them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.

First, we can factor out the 4:

$4(x + 7)(2 - x) = 4(x + 7)(2) - 4(x + 7)(x)$

Next, we can simplify the expression:

$4(x + 7)(2) - 4(x + 7)(x) = 8x + 56 - 4x^2 - 28x$

Finally, we can find the maximum value of the expression by setting the derivative equal to 0 and solving for x:

$\frac{d}{dx}(8x + 56 - 4x^2 - 28x) = 0$

$8 - 8x - 28 = 0$

$8x = 20$

$x = 2.5$

Substituting x = 2.5 into the original expression, we get:

$4(2.5 + 7)(2 - 2.5) = 4(9.5)(-0.5) = -18$

First, we need to factor the expression:

$a^2+6a-7 = a(a+6)-7$

Now, we need to find the minimum value of the expression. To do this, we need to find the value of $a$ that will give us the smallest result.

We can do this by setting the expression equal to 0 and solving for $a$:

$a(a+6)-7 = 0$

$a(a+6) = 7$

$a = -6$ or $a = \frac{7}{a}$

Now, we can plug in the value of $a$ into the original expression to find the minimum value:

$(-6)^2+6(-6)-7 = -30$

Therefore, the minimum value of $a^2+6a-7$ is -30.

First, we need to find the equation of the tangent line to the graph of f (x) = e^x - x^2. To do this, we need to find the derivative of f (x).

f'(x) = e^x - 2x

Now, we need to find the equation of the tangent line at a given point. Let's choose x = 0.

The equation of the tangent line at x = 0 is y = e^0 - 0^2 = 1.

Next, we need to find the equation of the secant line on the interval [0,1]. The equation of the secant line is y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept.

The slope of the secant line is the change in y divided by the change in x, which is (f(1) - f(0))/(1 - 0) = (e - 1)/1 = e - 1.

The y-intercept is f(0) = 1.

A competitive market structure is one in which there are many firms producing the same product, and each firm has a small market share. This means that each firm has to compete with the others in order to attract customers. As a result, the price of the product is likely to be lower than it would be in a monopoly, since the firms have to compete with each other to attract customers.

On the other hand, a monopoly is a market structure in which there is only one firm producing the same product. This means that the firm has no competition and can set the price of the product as high as it wants.

Given this information, the correct answer is (A) Price equal to marginal cost. In a competitive market structure, the price of the product is likely to be equal to the marginal cost, since the firms have to compete with each other to attract customers. In a monopoly, however, the price of the product is likely to be higher than the marginal cost, since the firm has no competition and can set the price as high as it wants.",scratchpad

First, we need to calculate the difference between the two decibel levels: 140 dB - 110 dB = 30 dB. 

Next, we need to calculate the percentage of noise being blocked. To do this, we divide the difference (30 dB) by the original decibel level (140 dB): 30 dB / 140 dB = 0.214. 

Finally, we need to convert this decimal into a percentage. To do this, we multiply the decimal by 100: 0.214 x 100 = 21.40%. 

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 21.40%.",scratchpad

First, we need to calculate the time it took for the arrow to reach the target. We can use the equation d = vt, where d is the distance, v is the initial velocity, and t is the time.

d = 20 m

We can rearrange the equation to solve for t: t = d/v.

Now, we can use the equation y = y0 + v0t + (1/2)at2, where y is the final vertical position, y0 is the initial vertical position, v0 is the initial velocity, a is the acceleration due to gravity, and t is the time.

y = 0.050 m

First, we need to calculate the probability that a single player had more than 143 offensive rebounds in one season. We can do this by dividing the number of players with more than 143 offensive rebounds (176 - 143 = 33) by the total number of players (176). This gives us a probability of 0.1875.

Next, we need to calculate the probability that at least three of the five players selected had more than 143 offensive rebounds. We can do this by using the binomial probability formula, which is P(X ≥ 3) = 1 - P(X ≤ 2).

Plugging in our values, we get P(X ≥ 3) = 1 - P(X ≤ 2) = 1 - (0.1875)^3 - 3(0.1875)^2(0.8125) - 3(0.1875)(0.8125)^2 - (0.8125)^3 = 0.8965.

The 28th percentile means that 28% of the onions are lighter than this onion. So, this onion is heavier than 72% of the onions. 

We can calculate the z-score for this onion by subtracting the mean from the weight of the onion and dividing by the standard deviation. 

z-score = (weight - mean) / standard deviation 
z-score = (9.8 - 9.8) / 2.1

The median is the middle number when the set is arranged in ascending order, so x and y must be equal. Therefore, x = y = 250.

First, we need to calculate the interquartile range (IQR). The IQR is the difference between the 75th percentile and the 25th percentile. 

Next, we need to calculate the 75th percentile and the 25th percentile. To do this, we need to calculate the z-score for each percentile. 

The z-score for the 75th percentile is 1.34. The z-score for the 25th percentile is -1.34. 

Now, we can calculate the 75th percentile and the 25th percentile. 

75th percentile = mean + (z-score * standard deviation) 
75th percentile = 640,000 + (1.34 * 18,000) 
75th percentile = 658,000 

25th percentile = mean + (z-score * standard deviation) 
25th percentile = 640,000 + (-1.34 * 18,000) 
25th percentile = 622,000

Standard deviation is a measure of how spread out a set of numbers is. The smaller the standard deviation, the closer the numbers are to each other. 

The set with the smallest standard deviation is III: {100}. This set only has one number, so the standard deviation is 0. 

The set with the largest standard deviation is II: {-10, 10}. This set has two numbers that are far apart, so the standard deviation is larger. 

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) III, I.",scratchpad

Our leaders talk about stopping aggression from the north, but this was a struggle among groups of Vietnamese until we intervened. We seem bent upon saving the Vietnamese from Ho Chi Minh even if we have to kill them and demolish their country to do it. As the native people survey bombed-out villages, women and children burned by napalm, rice crops destroyed and cities overrun with our military personnel, they are doubtless saying secretly of the Vietcong guerillas and of the American forces, ""A plague on both your houses."" … Stop the bombing, north and south, end search and destroy offensive sweeps, and confine our military action to holding operations on the ground.

The right of judging, in such cases, is an essential attribute of sovereignty, of which the States cannot be divested without losing their sovereignty itself, and being reduced to a subordinate corporate condition. In fact, to divide power, and to give to one of the parties the exclusive right of judging of the portion allotted to each, is, in reality, not to divide it at all; and to reserve such exclusive right to the General Government (it matters not by what department to be exercised), is to convert it, in fact, into a great consolidated government, with unlimited powers, and to divest the States, in reality, of all their rights, It is impossible to understand the force of terms, and to deny so plain a conclusion.""

An external tax is a duty laid on commodities imported; that duty is added to the first cost and other charges on the commodity, and, when it is offered for sale, makes a part of the price. If the people do not like it at that price, they refuse it; they are not obliged to pay it.

The Stamp Act says we shall have no commerce, make no exchange of property with each other, neither purchase nor grant, nor recover debts; we shall neither marry nor make our wills, unless we pay such and such sums; and thus it is intended to extort our money from us or ruin us by the consequence of refusing to pay it.""

""Society in every state is a blessing, but government even in its best state is but a necessary evil; in its worst state an intolerable one; for when we suffer, or are exposed to the same miseries by a government, which we might expect in a country without government, our calamity is heightened by reflecting that we furnish the means by which we suffer. Government, like dress, is the badge of lost innocence; the palaces of kings are built on the ruins of the bowers of paradise. For were the impulses of conscience clear, uniform, and irresistibly obeyed, man would need no other lawgiver; but that not being the case, he finds it necessary to surrender up a part of his property to furnish means for the protection of the rest; and this he is induced to do by the same prudence which in every other case advises him out of two evils to choose the least.

The Anti-Federalists were a group of people who opposed the ratification of the US Constitution because they believed it gave too much power to the federal government. Therefore, they would have agreed with President Reagan's statement. 

The Whig Party was a political party in the United States in the 1830s and 1840s that supported the federal government's role in economic development and infrastructure projects. Therefore, they would not have agreed with President Reagan's statement. 

The Mugwumps were a group of Republican Party members who supported Grover Cleveland in the 1884 presidential election. They were opposed to the corruption of the Republican Party and supported civil service reform. Therefore, they would not have agreed with President Reagan's statement.

One of the rights which the freeman has always guarded with most jealous care is that of enjoying the rewards of his own industry. Realizing that the power to tax is the power to destroy and that the power to take a certain amount of property or of income is only another way of saying that for a certain proportion of his time a citizen must work for the government, the authority to impose a tax on the people has been most carefully guarded.… A government which lays taxes on the people not required by urgent necessity and sound public policy is not a protector of liberty, but an instrument of tyranny. It condemns the citizen to tyranny. One of the first signs of the breaking down of free government is a disregard by the taxing power of the right of the people to their own property.… Unless the people can enjoy that reasonable security in the possession of their property, which is guaranteed by the Constitution, against unreasonable taxation, freedom is at an end.… With us economy is imperative.

When the fracture takes place at one end, if at the head of the thigh, the middle part of a thong wrapped round with wool, so that it may not cut the parts there, is to be applied to the perineum, and the ends of it brought up to the head and given to an assistant to hold, and applying a ligature below the fracture, we give the ends of it to another assistant to make extension. If it is fractured near the knee, we apply the ligature immediately above the fracture, and give the ends to an assistant, with which to make extension upwards; and while we put a ligature round the knee to secure it, and while the patient lies thus, with his leg extended, we arrange the fracture.""

""Medicine considers the human body as to the means by which it is cured and by which it is driven away from health. The knowledge of anything, since all things have causes, is not acquired or complete unless it is known by its causes. Therefore in medicine we ought to know the causes of sickness and health. And because health and sickness and their causes are sometimes manifest, and sometimes hidden and not to be comprehended except by the study of symptoms, we must also study the symptoms of health and disease. Now it is established in the sciences that no knowledge is acquired save through the study of its causes and beginnings, if it has had causes and beginnings; nor completed except by knowledge of its accidents and accompanying essentials.""

I overcame.
I destroyed its green fields and its wells,
I captured its cattle, I took captive its inhabitants, I deprived them of their provisions,
and I slew [many] people…by my sword, my bow, my marchings, and my good devices.
Thus my excellence was in his heart; he loved me and he knew my valor;
…he set me at the head of his sons, when he saw the success of my handiwork.
There came a champion of Syria

The North Atlantic Treaty was signed by its participating countries in 1949. This was after World War II, so the opportunity to re-take colonies lost after World War II would not be a factor. 

The treaty itself outlines the purpose of the alliance, which is to settle international disputes peacefully, strengthen free institutions, eliminate conflict in international economic policies, and to provide mutual aid and assistance in the event of an armed attack.

"This question refers to the following information.
""The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years, with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants. On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties. Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road. Can the worker-peasant alliance continue to stand in these circumstances? Obviously not! There is no solution to this problem except on a new basis. And that means to bring about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words, it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together.

""You may well ask: ""Why direct action? Why sit-ins, marches and so forth? Isn't negotiation a better path?"" You are quite right in calling, for negotiation. Indeed, this is the very purpose of direct action. Nonviolent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and foster such a tension that a community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue. It seeks so to dramatize the issue that it can no longer be ignored. My citing the creation of tension as part of the work of the nonviolent-resister may sound rather shocking. But I must confess that I am not afraid of the word ""tension."" I have earnestly opposed violent tension, but there is a type of constructive, nonviolent tension which is necessary for growth. Just as Socrates felt that it was necessary to create a tension in the mind so that individuals could rise from the bondage of myths and half-truths to the unfettered realm of creative analysis and objective appraisal, we must we see the need for nonviolent gadflies to create the kind of tension in society that will help men rise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism to the majestic heights of understanding and brotherhood.""

It is particularly important that children and young people be encouraged to develop their own talents and interests and to express their own individuality rather than act out stereotyped parts alien to their nature.

The passage tells us that Xuanzang was a monk who had no interest in honour and glory, and his only joy was to cultivate Nirvana. He was sent on imperial orders to fetch the scriptures. He prayed to be able to unseal the golden words and release the divine Monkey King to come with him to the Vulture Peak. 

Based on this information, the best answer is (B) as an example of the role played by interregional travelers in promoting understanding between cultures. Xuanzang's journey was an example of interregional travel, and his mission was to promote understanding between cultures by fetching the scriptures.",scratchpad

Questions to the passage below, an account given to a French officer in Algeria in the 1830s by a member of an Arab slave trade caravan.
The Slave Trade
All of you [soldiers], are summoned . . . to hunt the idolatrous Koholanes [a pejorative word for ""black Africans""]. . . . The soldiery divided themselves into two companies . . . with orders to attack places without defenses and to carry off the inhabitants as well as seizing all peasants busy cultivating their fields. . . . Whilst waiting for the return of the companies despatched to hunt Negroes, we went every day to the slave market where we bought at the following prices:
A Negro with beard………………10 or 15,000 cowries.
They are not considered as merchandise since one has little chance of preventing them from escaping.
An adult Negress………………..10 or 15,000 cowries for the same reasons
An adolescent Negro………………….30,000 cowries
A young Negress ……………………50–60,000 cowries
The price varies according to whether she is more or less beautiful.
A male Negro child……………………..45,000 cowries
A female Negro child ……………………….35–40,000 cowries
Finally, our caravan which had set out from Algeria with sixty-four camels and only sixteen persons, was now augmented by four hundred slaves, of whom three hundred were women. . . . It was at this point that suddenly a confused noise of cries and sobs passed from one group of slaves to another and reached our own. . . . Some rolled on the ground, clung to bushes and absolutely refused to walk. . . . They could only be got up with mighty lashes of the whip and by rendering them completely bloody.

It is not out of mere arrogance and perversity that I, an individual poor man, have taken upon me to address your lordships. The distress and misery that oppress all the Christian estates, more especially in Germany, have led not only myself, but every one else, to cry aloud and to ask for help. . . . These Romanists have, with great adroitness, drawn three walls around themselves, with which they have hitherto protected themselves, so that no one could reform them, whereby all Christendom has fallen terribly. . . . That the Temporal Power Has no Jurisdiction over the Spirituality . . . That No One May Interpret the Scriptures but the Pope . . . That No One May Call a Council but the Pope. . . . Let us now consider the matters which should be treated in the councils, and with which popes, cardinals, bishops, and all learned men should occupy themselves day and night. . . . It is a distressing and terrible thing to see that the head of Christendom, who boasts of being the vicar of Christ and the successor of St. Peter, lives in a worldly pomp that no king or emperor can equal. What is the use in Christendom of the people called ""cardinals""? I will tell you. In Italy and Germany there are many rich convents, endowments, fiefs, and benefices, and as the best way of getting these into the hands of Rome, they created cardinals, and gave them the sees, convents, and prelacies, and thus destroyed the service of God.

""You may well ask: ""Why direct action? Why sit-ins, marches and so forth? Isn't negotiation a better path?"" You are quite right in calling, for negotiation. Indeed, this is the very purpose of direct action. Nonviolent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and foster such a tension that a community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue. It seeks so to dramatize the issue that it can no longer be ignored. My citing the creation of tension as part of the work of the nonviolent-resister may sound rather shocking. But I must confess that I am not afraid of the word ""tension."" I have earnestly opposed violent tension, but there is a type of constructive, nonviolent tension which is necessary for growth. Just as Socrates felt that it was necessary to create a tension in the mind so that individuals could rise from the bondage of myths and half-truths to the unfettered realm of creative analysis and objective appraisal, we must we see the need for nonviolent gadflies to create the kind of tension in society that will help men rise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism to the majestic heights of understanding and brotherhood.""

The purpose of NOW is to take action to bring women into full participation in the mainstream of American society now, exercising all the privileges and responsibilities thereof in truly equal partnership with men.
We believe the time has come to move beyond the abstract argument, discussion and symposia over the status and special nature of women which has raged in America in recent years; the time has come to confront, with concrete action, the conditions that now prevent women from enjoying the equality of opportunity and freedom of which is their right, as individual Americans, and as human beings.""

""The long-term goal of Gay Liberation, which inevitably brings us into conflict with the institutionalized sexism of this society, is to rid society of the gender-role system which is at the root of our oppression. This can only be achieved by eliminating the social pressures on men and women to conform to narrowly defined gender roles. It is particularly important that children and young people be encouraged to develop their own talents and interests and to express their own individuality rather than act out stereotyped parts alien to their nature.
As we cannot carry out this revolutionary change alone, and as the abolition of gender rotes is also a necessary condition of women's liberation, we will work to form a strategic alliance with the women's liberation movement, aiming to develop our ideas and our practice in close inter-relation. In order to build this alliance, the brothers in gay liberation will have to be prepared to sacrifice that degree of male chauvinism and male privilege that they still all possess.""

"This question refers to the following information.
""At least one of the [world's] societies would have to somehow enormously increase its productivity [in order to achieve global hegemony]. That quantum jump would have to be made before the various scientific, technological, agricultural, and industrial revolutions on which our post-quantum-leap world rests.

First, we need to figure out how much volume the Empire State Building has. We can estimate that each story is about 10 meters tall, so the total height of the building is about 1000 meters. We can also estimate that the building is about 50 meters wide and 50 meters long. That means the total volume of the building is about 25,000,000 cubic meters. 

Now, we need to figure out how much volume a single balloon can hold. We can estimate that a single balloon can hold about 0.1 cubic meters of air. 

Finally, we can calculate the total number of balloons required to fill the Empire State Building. We can do this by dividing the total volume of the building (25,000,000 cubic meters) by the volume of a single balloon (0.1 cubic meters). This gives us a total of 250,000,000 balloons.

The evolutionary theory is a scientific theory that explains the process of evolution, so it is not related to geological processes and natural laws. 

The law of superposition states that in an undeformed sequence of sedimentary rocks, each layer is older than the one above it and younger than the one below it. This is related to geological processes, but it does not state that geological processes and natural laws that operate now have operated in the past. 

The law of thermodynamics is a scientific law that states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, so it is not related to geological processes and natural laws. 

The principle of uniformitarianism states that geological processes and natural laws that operate now have operated in the past. This is the correct answer.

Glycaemic index (GI) is a measure of how quickly a food is broken down into glucose and absorbed into the bloodstream. Generally, foods with a lower GI are better for blood sugar control. 

A baked apple will have a higher GI than a raw apple, as baking breaks down the cell walls of the apple, making it easier to digest and absorb. 

A raw potato will have a higher GI than a raw apple, as potatoes are starchier and more complex than apples. 

Apple juice will have a higher GI than a raw apple, as the juice is more concentrated and easier to digest.

First, we need to calculate the woman's basal metabolic rate (BMR). This is the amount of energy needed to keep the body functioning at rest. The formula for calculating BMR is:

BMR = 10 x weight (kg) + 6.25 x height (cm) - 5 x age (years) + 5

For this woman, the BMR would be:

BMR = 10 x 63 + 6.25 x - 5 x 43 + 5
     = 630 + -215 + 5
     = 420 kcal/day

Now, we need to multiply the BMR by an activity factor to get the total energy need. Since the woman is sedentary, we will use an activity factor of 1.2.

Total energy need = BMR x activity factor
                  = 420 x 1.2
                  = 504 kcal/day

Answer: A) 1250 kcal/day",scratchpad

The first option, (A), is the correct answer. There is a large 'dark figure' of unreported incidents, meaning that the true extent of domestic violence is difficult to ascertain. 

The second option, (B), is incorrect. The changing definitions of legal categories may make it harder to convict offenders, but it does not make it difficult to ascertain the true extent of domestic violence. 

The third option, (C), is incorrect. Researchers may not be allowed access to official statistics, but this does not make it difficult to ascertain the true extent of domestic violence.
