Beta cells in the pancreas are responsible for the secretion of insulin, which helps to regulate blood glucose levels. When the beta cells are destroyed, insulin secretion stops and blood glucose levels increase."

It can also dissociate into hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions, which is important for pH regulation. However, water is not a hydrophobic solvent, meaning it does not repel water molecules."

}]","Darwin's idea of the ""struggle for existence"" was strongly influenced by Malthus's essay on human population growth. Malthus argued that human populations tend to grow exponentially, while resources remain limited, leading to competition for resources and a struggle for existence. Darwin applied this idea to the natural world, arguing that competition for resources and a struggle for existence was a major factor in the evolution of species."

This is because the shape of the protein is determined by the arrangement of the amino acids, and a change in the amino acid composition can cause the protein to fold differently. This can affect the enzyme's ability to bind to its substrate, thus altering its substrate specificity."
