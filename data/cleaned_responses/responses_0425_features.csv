Therefore, the probability that a person has the disease, given that they tested positive, is 95% (of the 4% of the population that has the disease) divided by the total number of people who tested positive (95% of the 4% of the population that has the disease plus 5% of the 96% of the population that does not have the disease).

That day the Reverend Xuanzang was chosen from among all the monks. He had been a monk from infancy, and ever since birth he had eaten vegetarian food and observed the prohibitions. His maternal grandfather was an imperial commander, Yin Kaishan. His father Chen Guangrui had come top in the Palace Examination and had been appointed a grand secretary in the Imperial Library. Xuanzang, however, had no interest in honour and glory, and his only joy was to cultivate Nirvana. His virtue was great; of the thousand sutras and ten thousand holy books there was not a single one that he did not know.

He looked to the West and prayed, ""I am the believer Chen Xuanzang sent on imperial orders to fetch the scriptures.

The circumstance that has now taken place in France of the total abolition of the whole national order of priesthood, and of everything appertaining to compulsive systems of religion, and compulsive articles of faith, has not only precipitated my intention, but rendered a work of this kind exceedingly necessary, lest in the general wreck of superstition, of false systems of government, and false theology, we lose sight of morality, of humanity, and of the theology that is true.
I believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life.
I believe in the equality of man; and I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make our fellow-creatures happy.
I do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of. My own mind is my own church.
All national institutions of churches, whether Jewish, Christian or Turkish, appear to me no other than human inventions, set up to terrify and enslave mankind, and monopolize power and profit.
I do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise; they have the same right to their belief as I have to mine.

The Federal Reserve is an independent government agency that sets monetary policy. It does this by manipulating the money supply, which affects the cost of borrowing and the availability of credit. 

The most likely cause of a decrease in private investment as a result of an action by the Federal Reserve is (B) Lowering of the discount rate. The discount rate is the interest rate that the Federal Reserve charges commercial banks for short-term loans. When the discount rate is lowered, it makes it cheaper for banks to borrow money, which in turn makes it easier for businesses to access credit and invest in new projects.",B,high_school_macroeconomics,R_1gckVWV1J1rhJjG,rpp,expert,yes,4249.0,"EECS, Business Administration",1218,i would ask the chatbot questions that i would like it to answer,1,1,1,1,0.0,Economics,Comfortable,1,0,0,1,4,"(0, 5]",-1020027289657791698,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24509803921568626,0.1968503937007874

The person heterozygous for the recessive gene for cystic fibrosis has one copy of the recessive gene and one copy of the dominant gene. The other person is homozygous dominant, meaning they have two copies of the dominant gene. 

When the couple has a child, the child will receive one gene from each parent. The probability that the child will receive the recessive gene from the parent heterozygous for the recessive gene is 0.5 (50%).

A competitive market structure is one in which there are many firms producing the same product, and each firm has a small market share. This means that each firm has to compete with the others in order to attract customers. As a result, the price of the product is likely to be lower than it would be in a monopoly, since the firms have to compete with each other to attract customers.

On the other hand, a monopoly is a market structure in which there is only one firm producing the same product. This means that the firm has no competition and can set the price of the product as high as it wants.

Given this information, the correct answer is (A) Price equal to marginal cost. In a competitive market structure, the price of the product is likely to be equal to the marginal cost, since the firms have to compete with each other to attract customers. In a monopoly, however, the price of the product is likely to be higher than the marginal cost, since the firm has no competition and can set the price as high as it wants.",A,high_school_microeconomics,R_1gckVWV1J1rhJjG,rpp,expert,yes,4249.0,"EECS, Business Administration",1218,i would ask the chatbot questions that i would like it to answer,1,1,1,1,0.17142857142857135,Economics,Comfortable,1,0,0,1,4,"(10, 15]",-252796768289642610,1,0.0,4.0,7.0,0.4827586206896552,0.5714285714285714

""You may well ask: ""Why direct action? Why sit-ins, marches and so forth? Isn`t negotiation a better path?"" You are quite right in calling, for negotiation. Indeed, this is the very purpose of direct action. Nonviolent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and foster such a tension that a community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue. It seeks so to dramatize the issue that it can no longer be ignored. My citing the creation of tension as part of the work of the nonviolent-resister may sound rather shocking. But I must confess that I am not afraid of the word ""tension."" I have earnestly opposed violent tension, but there is a type of constructive, nonviolent tension which is necessary for growth. Just as Socrates felt that it was necessary to create a tension in the mind so that individuals could rise from the bondage of myths and half-truths to the unfettered realm of creative analysis and objective appraisal, we must we see the need for nonviolent gadflies to create the kind of tension in society that will help men rise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism to the majestic heights of understanding and brotherhood.""

This can only be achieved by eliminating the social pressures on men and women to conform to narrowly defined gender roles. It is particularly important that children and young people be encouraged to develop their own talents and interests and to express their own individuality rather than act out stereotyped parts alien to their nature.

""The Italian nation has been at last united in our own days, and we all rejoiced in its union. Yet we may be allowed to doubt whether the union was not a little too speedy and a little too thorough. It is surely carrying unity too far to wipe out all traces of the independent being, for most purposes to wipe out the very name, of such a land as Sicily. It jars on our feelings to find that, while Ireland at least forms part of the royal style of its sovereign, Sicily is no longer even a geographical expression. The island realm of Roger has sunk to be seven provinces of the kingdom on the mainland. And there is another result of Italian unity, a result in which we may rejoice without drawbacks, but which still has somewhat of sadness about it as finally ending that great phase of the history of Europe with which we have throughout been dealing. Never were ties with the past so fully snapped as when the army of Italy entered liberated Rome. Of all novelties in European history the greatest was when Rome became the centre of a dominion with acknowledged metes and bounds, the head in short of a local Italian kingdom.

One of the rights which the freeman has always guarded with most jealous care is that of enjoying the rewards of his own industry. Realizing that the power to tax is the power to destroy and that the power to take a certain amount of property or of income is only another way of saying that for a certain proportion of his time a citizen must work for the government, the authority to impose a tax on the people has been most carefully guarded.… A government which lays taxes on the people not required by urgent necessity and sound public policy is not a protector of liberty, but an instrument of tyranny. It condemns the citizen to tyranny. One of the first signs of the breaking down of free government is a disregard by the taxing power of the right of the people to their own property.… Unless the people can enjoy that reasonable security in the possession of their property, which is guaranteed by the Constitution, against unreasonable taxation, freedom is at an end.… With us economy is imperative.

The distress and misery that oppress all the Christian estates, more especially in Germany, have led not only myself, but every one else, to cry aloud and to ask for help. . . .

What is the use in Christendom of the people called ""cardinals""? I will tell you. In Italy and Germany there are many rich convents, endowments, fiefs, and benefices, and as the best way of getting these into the hands of Rome, they created cardinals, and gave them the sees, convents, and prelacies, and thus destroyed the service of God.

For the 176 players on the roster for one season of professional men`s basketball, the third quartile for the total number of offensive rebounds for one season was 143.

First, we need to calculate the probability that a single player had more than 143 offensive rebounds in one season. We can do this by dividing the number of players with more than 143 offensive rebounds (176 - 143 = 33) by the total number of players (176). This gives us a probability of 0.1875.

Next, we need to calculate the probability that at least three of the five players selected had more than 143 offensive rebounds. We can do this by using the binomial probability formula, which is P(X ≥ 3) = 1 - P(X ≤ 2).

Plugging in our values, we get P(X ≥ 3) = 1 - P(X ≤ 2) = 1 - (0.1875)^3 - 3(0.1875)^2(0.8125) - 3(0.1875)(0.8125)^2 - (0.8125)^3 = 0.8965.

Which of the following opinions from the 1960s most directly reflects the perspective of George McGovern`s speech?",Americans must maximize their technological edge in Vietnam.,American bombing in Vietnam is step by step leading to progress in the war.,American bombing in Vietnam is a failure.,America must not give in to defeatism about the war in Vietnam.,C,"

McGovern`s speech is about stopping aggression from the north, but also about the failure of American bombing in Vietnam. He suggests that bombing the north has failed to halt or seriously check the flow of troops to the south and may, in fact, have prompted a much greater war effort by Hanoi. He also suggests that the American forces should confine their military action to holding operations on the ground. 

Therefore, the correct answer is C: American bombing in Vietnam is a failure.",C,high_school_us_history,R_1N9OJy9zzuKNduF,rpp,expert,yes,10656.0,"Business Administration, Computer Science, Data Science",1641,I used it to help explain a concept that I didn't understand from a textbook,1,1,1,0,0.5446428571428571,History,Uncomfortable,-1,1,0,0,3,"(15, 20]",1954562260106531436,1,1.0,15.0,1.0,0.23809523809523808,0.6530612244897959

And they are not paid for the labor of traveling to and from the mines or for the time they spend at the mines. The Indians, under the pretext of mining chores, are made to spend their workdays herding cattle and conveying goods; they are sent off to the plains, and the Indians die. These Indians are not paid for their labor, and their work is kept hidden.
And [the mine owners] keep Indian cooking women in their residences; they use cooking as a pretext for taking concubines….And they oblige the Indians to accept corn or meat or chicha [corn beer]…at their own expense, and they deduct the price from their labor and their workdays. In this way, the Indians end up very poor and deep in debt, and they have no way to pay their tribute.
There is no remedy for all this, because any [colonial official] who enters comes to an agreement with the mine owners, and all the owners join forces in bribing him….Even the protector of the Indians is useless;…he [does not] warn Your Majesty or your royal Audiencia [court] about the harms done to the poor Indians.""

The revolutionary seed had penetrated into every country and spread more or less. It was greatly developed under the régime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.
The monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.
Union between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .
Let them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.
Let them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.
Let them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.
Let them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.

The lowest direct cost would be natural seeding, since it does not require any additional resources or labor. 

The slowest method would be planting seedlings, since it requires more labor and resources to nurture the seedlings until they are ready to be planted. 

The least reliable method would be planting cuttings, since cuttings are more prone to disease and other environmental factors that can affect their success rate.

First, we need to calculate the concentration of the acid in the solution. We can do this by using the molar mass of the acid and the amount of acid that was dissolved in the solution. 

Molar mass of acid = 248 g/mol
Amount of acid = 0.0050 mol

Concentration of acid = 0.0050 mol/0.500 L = 0.01 mol/L

Now, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to calculate the pKa of the acid. 

pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])

3.89 = pKa + log(0.01/[HA])

pKa = 3.89 - log(0.01/[HA])

First, we need to calculate the concentration of the acid in the solution. We can do this by using the molar mass of the acid and the amount of acid that was dissolved in the solution. 

Molar mass of acid = 248 g/mol
Amount of acid = 0.0050 mol

Concentration of acid = 0.0050 mol/0.500 L = 0.01 mol/L

Now, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to calculate the pKa of the acid. 

pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])

3.89 = pKa + log(0.01/[HA])

pKa = 3.89 - log(0.01/[HA])

pKa = 3.89 - (-2.00)

First, we need to calculate the time it took for the arrow to reach the target. We can use the equation d = vt, where d is the distance, v is the initial velocity, and t is the time.

d = 20 m

We can rearrange the equation to solve for t: t = d/v.

Now, we can use the equation y = y0 + v0t + (1/2)at2, where y is the final vertical position, y0 is the initial vertical position, v0 is the initial velocity, a is the acceleration due to gravity, and t is the time.

y = 0.050 m
y0 = 0 m
v0 = ?
a = -9.8 m/s2
t = d/v

We can rearrange the equation to solve for v0: v0 = (y - y0)/(t + (1/2)at2).

",1250 kcal/day,1350 kcal/day,1525 kcal/day,1800 kcal/day,B,"

First, we need to calculate the woman`s basal metabolic rate (BMR). This is the amount of energy needed to keep the body functioning at rest. The formula for calculating BMR is:

BMR = 10 x weight (kg) + 6.25 x height (cm) - 5 x age (years) + 5

For this woman, the BMR would be:

BMR = 10 x 63 + 6.25 x - 5 x 43 + 5
     = 630 + -215 + 5
     = 420 kcal/day

Now, we need to multiply the BMR by an activity factor to get the total energy need. Since the woman is sedentary, we will use an activity factor of 1.2.

Total energy need = BMR x activity factor
                  = 420 x 1.2
                  = 504 kcal/day

The strongest research technique for determining genetic contributions to longevity would be to compare something that has a genetic component. 

Siblings and parents would be a good comparison, but identical and fraternal twins would be a better comparison because they share the same genetic makeup. 

Ancestors of different families would not be a good comparison because they do not share the same genetic makeup. 

Centenarians to younger adults would also not be a good comparison because the younger adults may not have the same genetic makeup as the centenarians.

Next, we need to consider the likelihood of each group staying at home alone. According to a 2019 survey, Asian Americans are the most likely to stay at home alone, with nearly half of them reporting that they do so. Hispanic Americans are the least likely to stay at home alone, with only about a quarter of them reporting that they do so. African Americans and white Americans are both in the middle, with around a third of each group reporting that they stay at home alone.

In some States, a married woman may hold property and transact business in her own name; in others, her earnings belong to her husband. In some States, a woman may testify against her husband, sue and be sued in the courts; in others, she has no redress in case of damage to person, property, or character. In case of divorce on account of adultery in the husband, the innocent wife is held to possess no right to children or property, unless by special decree of the court. But in no State of the Union has the wife the right to her own person, or to any part of the joint earnings of the co-partnership during the life of her husband.

""The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years, with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants. On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties. Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road. Can the worker-peasant alliance continue to stand in these circumstances? Obviously not! There is no solution to this problem except on a new basis. And that means to bring about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words, it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together. We maintain that this is the only way to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance.""

First, we need to calculate the difference between the two decibel levels: 140 dB - 110 dB = 30 dB. 

Next, we need to calculate the percentage of noise being blocked. To do this, we divide the difference (30 dB) by the original decibel level (140 dB): 30 dB / 140 dB = 0.214. 

Finally, we need to convert this decimal into a percentage. To do this, we multiply the decimal by 100: 0.214 x 100 = 21.40%.

The right of judging, in such cases, is an essential attribute of sovereignty, of which the States cannot be divested without losing their sovereignty itself, and being reduced to a subordinate corporate condition. In fact, to divide power, and to give to one of the parties the exclusive right of judging of the portion allotted to each, is, in reality, not to divide it at all; and to reserve such exclusive right to the General Government (it matters not by what department to be exercised), is to convert it, in fact, into a great consolidated government, with unlimited powers, and to divest the States, in reality, of all their rights, It is impossible to understand the force of terms, and to deny so plain a conclusion.""

Glycaemic index (GI) is a measure of how quickly a food is broken down into glucose and absorbed into the bloodstream. Generally, foods with a lower GI are better for blood sugar control. 

A baked apple will have a higher GI than a raw apple, as baking breaks down the cell walls of the apple, making it easier to digest and absorb. 

A raw potato will have a higher GI than a raw apple, as potatoes are starchier and more complex than apples. 

Apple juice will have a higher GI than a raw apple, as the juice is more concentrated and easier to digest.

And [the mine owners] keep Indian cooking women in their residences; they use cooking as a pretext for taking concubines….And they oblige the Indians to accept corn or meat or chicha [corn beer]…at their own expense, and they deduct the price from their labor and their workdays. In this way, the Indians end up very poor and deep in debt, and they have no way to pay their tribute.
There is no remedy for all this, because any [colonial official] who enters comes to an agreement with the mine owners, and all the owners join forces in bribing him….Even the protector of the Indians is useless;…he [does not] warn Your Majesty or your royal Audiencia [court] about the harms done to the poor Indians.""

Which of the following conclusions about the period 1450–1750 C.E. is most directly supported by the passage?",The population of the Americas declined.,Silver flows from the Americas went principally to Europe and Asia.,The religious traditions and social customs of the New World were dramatically altered by the arrival of Europeans.,Intermarriage between Spanish colonists and natives led to equality between the races.,A,"

The passage is about the quicksilver mines of Huancavelica, the silver mines of Potosi, and other mines in the Americas during the period 1450–1750 C.E. It talks about how the mine owners, whether Spaniards, mestizos, or Indians, were tyrants and how the Indians were not paid for their labor and were kept in debt. It also mentions how the colonial officials were bribed by the mine owners.

Given this information, the conclusion that is most directly supported by the passage is (C) The religious traditions and social customs of the New World were dramatically altered by the arrival of Europeans.",C,high_school_world_history,R_3JfMsCNyXVzS28n,rpp,expert,yes,2760.0,"EECS, Business Administration",3257,used for learning and studying concepts,1,1,1,1,0.27536231884057966,History,Neutral,0,0,1,0,4,"(30, 35]",5953153046469663978,0,1.0,22.0,11.0,0.25,0.45652173913043476

Patrick Henry was a leader in the American Revolution, which was a fight for independence from Britain. He was also a passionate advocate for liberty and freedom. 

The nineteenth century saw a number of groups fighting for freedom and liberty, including abolitionists, who fought to end slavery, and supporters of Manifest Destiny, who sought to expand the United States. 

However, the group that most directly saw themselves as following in the tradition of Patrick Henry were the Southern secessionists, who sought to secede from the United States in order to preserve their own liberty and freedom.

The Slave Trade
All of you [soldiers], are summoned . . . to hunt the idolatrous Koholanes [a pejorative word for ""black Africans""]. . . . The soldiery divided themselves into two companies . . . with orders to attack places without defenses and to carry off the inhabitants as well as seizing all peasants busy cultivating their fields. . . . Whilst waiting for the return of the companies despatched to hunt Negroes, we went every day to the slave market where we bought at the following prices:
A Negro with beard………………10 or 15,000 cowries.
They are not considered as merchandise since one has little chance of preventing them from escaping.
An adult Negress………………..10 or 15,000 cowries for the same reasons
An adolescent Negro………………….30,000 cowries
A young Negress ……………………50–60,000 cowries
The price varies according to whether she is more or less beautiful.
A male Negro child……………………..45,000 cowries
A female Negro child ……………………….35–40,000 cowries
Finally, our caravan which had set out from Algeria with sixty-four camels and only sixteen persons, was now augmented by four hundred slaves, of whom three hundred were women. . . . It was at this point that suddenly a confused noise of cries and sobs passed from one group of slaves to another and reached our own. . . . Some rolled on the ground, clung to bushes and absolutely refused to walk. . . . They could only be got up with mighty lashes of the whip and by rendering them completely bloody.

The evolutionary theory is a scientific theory that explains the process of evolution, so it is not related to geological processes and natural laws. 

The law of superposition states that in an undeformed sequence of sedimentary rocks, each layer is older than the one above it and younger than the one below it. This is related to geological processes, but it does not state that geological processes and natural laws that operate now have operated in the past. 

The law of thermodynamics is a scientific law that states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, so it is not related to geological processes and natural laws. 

The principle of uniformitarianism states that geological processes and natural laws that operate now have operated in the past. This is the correct answer.

""The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years, with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants. On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties. Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road. Can the worker-peasant alliance continue to stand in these circumstances? Obviously not! There is no solution to this problem except on a new basis. And that means to bring about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words, it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together.

And strike each haughty tyrant down,
With hatchet, pike, and gun!

The shear frames broke,

What though the specials still advance,
And soldiers nightly round us prance;
The cropper lads still lead the dance,

Such an omission might, however, arise from various other causes, and it is probable that in Rajputana, Central India, and Chota Nagpur there were numerous chiefs and tribes occupying what constitutional lawyers would regard as an anomalous position, sometimes paying the stipulated revenue, sometimes in open rebellion, and sometimes enjoying practical independence because the Mogul authorities found it inconvenient to undertake active measures of coercion.""

""You may well ask: ""Why direct action? Why sit-ins, marches and so forth? Isn`t negotiation a better path?"" You are quite right in calling, for negotiation. Indeed, this is the very purpose of direct action. Nonviolent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and foster such a tension that a community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue. It seeks so to dramatize the issue that it can no longer be ignored. My citing the creation of tension as part of the work of the nonviolent-resister may sound rather shocking. But I must confess that I am not afraid of the word ""tension."" I have earnestly opposed violent tension, but there is a type of constructive, nonviolent tension which is necessary for growth. Just as Socrates felt that it was necessary to create a tension in the mind so that individuals could rise from the bondage of myths and half-truths to the unfettered realm of creative analysis and objective appraisal, we must we see the need for nonviolent gadflies to create the kind of tension in society that will help men rise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism to the majestic heights of understanding and brotherhood.""

""The long-term goal of Gay Liberation, which inevitably brings us into conflict with the institutionalized sexism of this society, is to rid society of the gender-role system which is at the root of our oppression. This can only be achieved by eliminating the social pressures on men and women to conform to narrowly defined gender roles. It is particularly important that children and young people be encouraged to develop their own talents and interests and to express their own individuality rather than act out stereotyped parts alien to their nature.
As we cannot carry out this revolutionary change alone, and as the abolition of gender rotes is also a necessary condition of women`s liberation, we will work to form a strategic alliance with the women`s liberation movement, aiming to develop our ideas and our practice in close inter-relation. In order to build this alliance, the brothers in gay liberation will have to be prepared to sacrifice that degree of male chauvinism and male privilege that they still all possess.""

First, we need to figure out how much volume the Empire State Building has. We can estimate that each story is about 10 meters tall, so the total height of the building is about 1000 meters. We can also estimate that the building is about 50 meters wide and 50 meters long. That means the total volume of the building is about 25,000,000 cubic meters. 

Now, we need to figure out how much volume a single balloon can hold. We can estimate that a single balloon can hold about 0.1 cubic meters of air. 

Finally, we can calculate the total number of balloons required to fill the Empire State Building. We can do this by dividing the total volume of the building (25,000,000 cubic meters) by the volume of a single balloon (0.1 cubic meters). This gives us a total of 250,000,000 balloons.

The question is asking which author was most critical of the policy being described here by President Jackson. President Jackson is not mentioned in the passage, so we can eliminate this choice. 

The passage is discussing the Stamp Act of 1766, so the author must have been critical of this policy. 

The correct answer is (D) William Lloyd Garrison in The Liberator.

You will do me the justice to remember, that I have always strenuously supported the Right of every man to his own opinion, however different that opinion might be to mine. He who denies to another this right, makes a slave of himself to his present opinion, because he precludes himself the right of changing it.
The most formidable weapon against errors of every kind is Reason. I have never used any other, and I trust I never shall.
The circumstance that has now taken place in France of the total abolition of the whole national order of priesthood, and of everything appertaining to compulsive systems of religion, and compulsive articles of faith, has not only precipitated my intention, but rendered a work of this kind exceedingly necessary, lest in the general wreck of superstition, of false systems of government, and false theology, we lose sight of morality, of humanity, and of the theology that is true.
I believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life.
I believe in the equality of man; and I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make our fellow-creatures happy.
I do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of. My own mind is my own church.
All national institutions of churches, whether Jewish, Christian or Turkish, appear to me no other than human inventions, set up to terrify and enslave mankind, and monopolize power and profit.

The passage below is written by John Calvin.
If we need to be recalled to the origin of election, to prove that we obtain salvation from no other source than the mere goodness of God, they who desire to extinguish this principle, do all they can to obscure what ought to be magnificently and loudly celebrated, and to pluck up humility by the roots. In ascribing the salvation of the remnant of the people to the election of grace, Paul clearly testifies, that it is then only known that God saves whom upon which there can be no claim. They who shut the gates to prevent anyone from presuming to approach and taste this doctrine, do no less injury to man than to God; for nothing else will be sufficient to produce in us suitable humility, or to impress us with a due sense of our great obligations to God. Nor is there any other basis for solid confidence, even according to the authority of Christ, who, to deliver us from all fear, and render us invincible amidst so many dangers, snares, and deadly conflicts, promises to preserve in safety all whom the Father has committed to His care.

Here is the case of a woman employed in the manufacturing department of a Broadway house. It stands for a hundred like her own. She averages three dollars a week. Pay is $1.50 for her room; for breakfast she has a cup of coffee; lunch she cannot afford. One meal a day is her allowance. This woman is young, she is pretty. She has ""the world before her."" Is it anything less than a miracle if she is guilty of nothing less than the ""early and improvident marriage,"" against which moralists exclaim as one of the prolific causes of the distresses of the poor? Almost any door might seem to offer a welcome escape from such slavery as this. ""I feel so much healthier since I got three square meals a day,"" said a lodger in one of the Girls` Homes. Two young sewing-girls came in seeking domestic service, so that they might get enough to eat. They had been only half-fed for some time, and starvation had driven them to the one door at which the pride of the American-born girl will not permit her to knock, though poverty be the price of her independence.

Government, like dress, is the badge of lost innocence; the palaces of kings are built on the ruins of the bowers of paradise. For were the impulses of conscience clear, uniform, and irresistibly obeyed, man would need no other lawgiver; but that not being the case, he finds it necessary to surrender up a part of his property to furnish means for the protection of the rest; and this he is induced to do by the same prudence which in every other case advises him out of two evils to choose the least.

This means that each firm has to compete with the others in order to attract customers. As a result, the price of the product is likely to be lower than it would be in a monopoly, since the firms have to compete with each other to attract customers.

On the other hand, a monopoly is a market structure in which there is only one firm producing the same product. This means that the firm has no competition and can set the price of the product as high as it wants.

Given this information, the correct answer is (A) Price equal to marginal cost. In a competitive market structure, the price of the product is likely to be equal to the marginal cost, since the firms have to compete with each other to attract customers. In a monopoly, however, the price of the product is likely to be higher than the marginal cost, since the firm has no competition and can set the price as high as it wants.",A,high_school_microeconomics,R_SZAOxj7gcQfgLfP,rpp,AI chatbot,yes,-4672.0,Business Administration,5736,I had an assignment that required/instructed the use of an AI chatbot. ,1,1,1,0,0.0,Economics,Comfortable,1,0,0,1,3,"(0, 5]",-252796768289642610,1,0.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

First, we need to determine the order of the reaction. To do this, we need to look at the equation and determine how many molecules of each reactant are involved in the reaction. In this case, we can see that two molecules of A and one molecule of B are involved in the reaction. Therefore, the reaction is second order with respect to A and first order with respect to B. 

Now, we can determine the rate law. The rate law is an equation that describes how the rate of a reaction is affected by the concentrations of the reactants. In this case, the rate law would be k[A]2[B], where k is the rate constant.

First, we need to calculate the interquartile range (IQR). The IQR is the difference between the 75th percentile and the 25th percentile. 

Next, we need to calculate the 75th percentile and the 25th percentile. To do this, we need to calculate the z-score for each percentile. 

The z-score for the 75th percentile is 1.34. The z-score for the 25th percentile is -1.34. 

Now, we can calculate the 75th percentile and the 25th percentile. 

75th percentile = mean + (z-score * standard deviation) 
75th percentile = 640,000 + (1.34 * 18,000) 
75th percentile = 658,000 

25th percentile = mean + (z-score * standard deviation) 
25th percentile = 640,000 + (-1.34 * 18,000)

On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties. Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road. Can the worker-peasant alliance continue to stand in these circumstances? Obviously not! There is no solution to this problem except on a new basis.

I am the Hope of the poor crazed beings who pine in the cells, and stalls, and cages, and waste rooms of your poor-houses.

First, we need to calculate the concentration of the acid in the solution. We can do this by using the molar mass of the acid and the amount of acid that was dissolved in the solution. 

Molar mass of acid = 248 g/mol
Amount of acid = 0.0050 mol

Concentration of acid = 0.0050 mol/0.500 L = 0.01 mol/L

Now, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to calculate the pKa of the acid. 

pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])

3.89 = pKa + log(0.01/[HA])

pKa = 3.89 - log(0.01/[HA])

pKa = 3.89 - (-2.00)

The revolutionary seed had penetrated into every country and spread more or less. It was greatly developed under the régime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.
The monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.
Union between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .
Let them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.

""You may well ask: ""Why direct action? Why sit-ins, marches and so forth? Isn`t negotiation a better path?"" You are quite right in calling, for negotiation. Indeed, this is the very purpose of direct action. Nonviolent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and foster such a tension that a community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue. It seeks so to dramatize the issue that it can no longer be ignored. My citing the creation of tension as part of the work of the nonviolent-resister may sound rather shocking. But I must confess that I am not afraid of the word ""tension."" I have earnestly opposed violent tension, but there is a type of constructive, nonviolent tension which is necessary for growth. Just as Socrates felt that it was necessary to create a tension in the mind so that individuals could rise from the bondage of myths and half-truths to the unfettered realm of creative analysis and objective appraisal, we must we see the need for nonviolent gadflies to create the kind of tension in society that will help men rise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism to the majestic heights of understanding and brotherhood.""

""We, men and women, who hereby constitute ourselves as the National Organization for Women, believe that the time has come for a new movement toward true equality for all women in America, and toward a fully equal partnership of the sexes, as part of the world-wide revolution of human rights now taking place within and beyond our national borders.
The purpose of NOW is to take action to bring women into full participation in the mainstream of American society now, exercising all the privileges and responsibilities thereof in truly equal partnership with men.
We believe the time has come to move beyond the abstract argument, discussion and symposia over the status and special nature of women which has raged in America in recent years; the time has come to confront, with concrete action, the conditions that now prevent women from enjoying the equality of opportunity and freedom of which is their right, as individual Americans, and as human beings.""

""The long-term goal of Gay Liberation, which inevitably brings us into conflict with the institutionalized sexism of this society, is to rid society of the gender-role system which is at the root of our oppression. This can only be achieved by eliminating the social pressures on men and women to conform to narrowly defined gender roles. It is particularly important that children and young people be encouraged to develop their own talents and interests and to express their own individuality rather than act out stereotyped parts alien to their nature.
As we cannot carry out this revolutionary change alone, and as the abolition of gender rotes is also a necessary condition of women`s liberation, we will work to form a strategic alliance with the women`s liberation movement, aiming to develop our ideas and our practice in close inter-relation. In order to build this alliance, the brothers in gay liberation will have to be prepared to sacrifice that degree of male chauvinism and male privilege that they still all possess.""

One of the rights which the freeman has always guarded with most jealous care is that of enjoying the rewards of his own industry. Realizing that the power to tax is the power to destroy and that the power to take a certain amount of property or of income is only another way of saying that for a certain proportion of his time a citizen must work for the government, the authority to impose a tax on the people has been most carefully guarded.… A government which lays taxes on the people not required by urgent necessity and sound public policy is not a protector of liberty, but an instrument of tyranny. It condemns the citizen to tyranny. One of the first signs of the breaking down of free government is a disregard by the taxing power of the right of the people to their own property.… Unless the people can enjoy that reasonable security in the possession of their property, which is guaranteed by the Constitution, against unreasonable taxation, freedom is at an end.… With us economy is imperative.

An external tax is a duty laid on commodities imported; that duty is added to the first cost and other charges on the commodity, and, when it is offered for sale, makes a part of the price. If the people do not like it at that price, they refuse it; they are not obliged to pay it. But an internal tax is forced from the people without their consent if not laid by their own representatives. The Stamp Act says we shall have no commerce, make no exchange of property with each other, neither purchase nor grant, nor recover debts; we shall neither marry nor make our wills, unless we pay such and such sums; and thus it is intended to extort our money from us or ruin us by the consequence of refusing to pay it.""

The North Atlantic Treaty was signed by its participating countries in 1949. This was after World War II, so the opportunity to re-take colonies lost after World War II would not be a factor. 

The treaty itself outlines the purpose of the alliance, which is to settle international disputes peacefully, strengthen free institutions, eliminate conflict in international economic policies, and to provide mutual aid and assistance in the event of an armed attack.

The buoyant force on the balloon is determined by the volume of air displaced by the balloon. Since the balloon is spherical, the volume of air displaced is proportional to the cube of the radius. Therefore, if the radius is doubled, the volume of air displaced will increase by a factor of 8. This means that the buoyant force on the balloon will increase by a factor of 8.

The object is initially at rest, so it has a velocity of 0 m/s. 

The acceleration is given by a = (2 m/s^3)t for t ≥ 0. 

The object will travel for 3 seconds, so we can calculate the velocity at t = 3 seconds. 

The velocity at t = 3 seconds is given by v = (2 m/s^3) * 3 = 6 m/s. 

Now, we can calculate the distance traveled in 3 seconds. 

The distance traveled in 3 seconds is given by d = v * t = 6 m/s * 3 s = 18 m.

First, we need to calculate the time it took for the arrow to reach the target. We can use the equation d = vt, where d is the distance, v is the initial velocity, and t is the time.

d = 20 m
v = ?
t = ?

We can rearrange the equation to solve for t: t = d/v.

Now, we can use the equation y = y0 + v0t + (1/2)at2, where y is the final vertical position, y0 is the initial vertical position, v0 is the initial velocity, a is the acceleration due to gravity, and t is the time.

y = 0.050 m
y0 = 0 m
v0 = ?
a = -9.8 m/s2
t = d/v

We can rearrange the equation to solve for v0: v0 = (y - y0)/(t + (1/2)at2).

""The Italian nation has been at last united in our own days, and we all rejoiced in its union. Yet we may be allowed to doubt whether the union was not a little too speedy and a little too thorough.

The island realm of Roger has sunk to be seven provinces of the kingdom on the mainland.

Never were ties with the past so fully snapped as when the army of Italy entered liberated Rome. Of all novelties in European history the greatest was when Rome became the centre of a dominion with acknowledged metes and bounds, the head in short of a local Italian kingdom.

A gamete is a reproductive cell, such as a sperm or egg cell. A heritable change in a protein is a change that can be passed down from one generation to the next. 

In order for a heritable change to occur, the change must be made to the genetic material of the gamete. This means that the change must be made to the DNA or RNA of the gamete.

What shall I say concerning its mastery of and its waste of mechanical power, its commonwealth so poor, its enemies of the commonwealth so rich, its stupendous organization—for the misery of life! Its contempt of simple pleasures which everyone could enjoy but for its folly? Its eyeless vulgarity which has destroyed art, the one certain solace of labor? All this I felt then as now, but I did not know why it was so.

This was a bad lookout indeed, and, if I may mention myself as a personality and not as a mere type, especially so to a man of my disposition, careless of metaphysics and religion, as well as of scientific analysis, but with a deep love of the earth and the life on it, and a passion for the history of the past of mankind.

Polar molecules have a net dipole moment, meaning that the molecule has an uneven distribution of electrons. 

A) PCl4F - This molecule has four polar bonds, but the molecule is symmetrical, meaning that the dipole moments cancel each other out. Therefore, this molecule is not polar. 

B) BF3 - This molecule has three polar bonds, but the molecule is also symmetrical, meaning that the dipole moments cancel each other out. Therefore, this molecule is not polar. 

C) CO2 - This molecule has two polar bonds, but the molecule is linear, meaning that the dipole moments do not cancel each other out. Therefore, this molecule is polar. 

D) Si(CH3)4 - This molecule has four non-polar bonds, meaning that the molecule is not polar.

First, we need to calculate the total value of production in Country Z. To do this, we need to multiply the quantity of each good produced by its price. 

For hot dogs, we have 4 hot dogs x $1.00 = $4.00. 
For buns, we have 4 buns x $0.50 = $2.00.

He knows that each student will need to use 0.797 grams of magnesium in the first step of the experiment and 0.892 grams in a later step. He uses front-end estimation with an adjustment to figure out the approximate amount of magnesium needed by each student. What is his estimate?,1.4 g,1.7 g,1.6 g,1.5 g,B,"

Dr. Sperline is using front-end estimation, which means he is rounding the numbers to the nearest whole number. So, 0.797 grams of magnesium becomes 1 gram and 0.892 grams of magnesium becomes 1 gram. 

Now, he needs to adjust his estimate to account for the difference between the rounded numbers and the actual numbers. In this case, the difference is 0.203 grams. 

So, the total amount of magnesium needed by each student is 1 + 1 + 0.203 = 2.203 grams.

For the 176 players on the roster for one season of professional men`s basketball, the third quartile for the total number of offensive rebounds for one season was 143. If five players are selected at random (with replacement) from that season, what is the approximate probability that at least three of them had more than 143 rebounds that season?",0.0127,0.0879,0.1035,0.8965,C,"

First, we need to calculate the probability that a single player had more than 143 offensive rebounds in one season. We can do this by dividing the number of players with more than 143 offensive rebounds (176 - 143 = 33) by the total number of players (176). This gives us a probability of 0.1875.

Next, we need to calculate the probability that at least three of the five players selected had more than 143 offensive rebounds. We can do this by using the binomial probability formula, which is P(X ≥ 3) = 1 - P(X ≤ 2).

Plugging in our values, we get P(X ≥ 3) = 1 - P(X ≤ 2) = 1 - (0.1875)^3 - 3(0.1875)^2(0.8125) - 3(0.1875)(0.8125)^2 - (0.8125)^3 = 0.8965.

Government, like dress, is the badge of lost innocence; the palaces of kings are built on the ruins of the bowers of paradise. For were the impulses of conscience clear, uniform, and irresistibly obeyed, man would need no other lawgiver; but that not being the case, he finds it necessary to surrender up a part of his property to furnish means for the protection of the rest; and this he is induced to do by the same prudence which in every other case advises him out of two evils to choose the least.

Next, we need to calculate the current through the resistor. The current is equal to the power of the light divided by the voltage across the photocell, so the current is 100 W / (2 × 10^15 V) = 0.5 × 10^-14 A.

Next, we know that the blood test gives a positive reading for 95% of people who have the disease and for 5% of people who do not have the disease. 

Therefore, the probability that a person has the disease, given that they tested positive, is 95% (of the 4% of the population that has the disease) divided by the total number of people who tested positive (95% of the 4% of the population that has the disease plus 5% of the 96% of the population that does not have the disease).

The mass of the object is 5.0 kg. This means that the force of gravity acting on the object is 5.0 kg x 9.8 m/s2 = 49 N. 

However, the elevator is accelerating upwards at 4.0 m/s2. This means that the object is being pushed upwards with an additional force of 4.0 m/s2 x 5.0 kg = 20 N.

And they are not paid for the labor of traveling to and from the mines or for the time they spend at the mines. The Indians, under the pretext of mining chores, are made to spend their workdays herding cattle and conveying goods; they are sent off to the plains, and the Indians die. These Indians are not paid for their labor, and their work is kept hidden.
And [the mine owners] keep Indian cooking women in their residences; they use cooking as a pretext for taking concubines….And they oblige the Indians to accept corn or meat or chicha [corn beer]…at their own expense, and they deduct the price from their labor and their workdays. In this way, the Indians end up very poor and deep in debt, and they have no way to pay their tribute.
There is no remedy for all this, because any [colonial official] who enters comes to an agreement with the mine owners, and all the owners join forces in bribing him….Even the protector of the Indians is useless;…he [does not] warn Your Majesty or your royal Audiencia [court] about the harms done to the poor Indians.""

First, we need to calculate the interquartile range (IQR). The IQR is the difference between the 75th percentile and the 25th percentile. 

Next, we need to calculate the 75th percentile and the 25th percentile. To do this, we need to calculate the z-score for each percentile. 

The z-score for the 75th percentile is 1.34. The z-score for the 25th percentile is -1.34. 

Now, we can calculate the 75th percentile and the 25th percentile. 

75th percentile = mean + (z-score * standard deviation) 
75th percentile = 640,000 + (1.34 * 18,000) 
75th percentile = 658,000 

25th percentile = mean + (z-score * standard deviation) 
25th percentile = 640,000 + (-1.34 * 18,000) 
25th percentile = 622,000

Read the following governmental report.
Of the 450 sick persons whom the inhabitants were unable to relieve, 200 were turned out, and these we saw die one by one as they lay on the roadside. A large number still remain, and to each of them it is only possible to dole out the least scrap of bread. We only give bread to those who would otherwise die. The staple dish here consists of mice, which the inhabitants hunt, so desperate are they from hunger. They devour roots which the animals cannot eat; one can, in fact, not put into words the things one sees. . . . This narrative, far from exaggerating, rather understates the horror of the case, for it does not record the hundredth part of the misery in this district. Those who have not witnessed it with their own eyes cannot imagine how great it is. Not a day passes but at least 200 people die of famine in the two provinces. We certify to having ourselves seen herds, not of cattle, but of men and women, wandering about the fields between Rheims and Rhétel, turning up the earth like pigs to find a few roots; and as they can only find rotten ones, and not half enough of them, they become so weak that they have not strength left to seek food. The parish priest at Boult, whose letter we enclose, tells us he has buried three of his parishioners who died of hunger. The rest subsisted on chopped straw mixed with earth, of which they composed a food which cannot be called bread. Other persons in the same place lived on the bodies of animals which had died of disease, and which the curé, otherwise unable to help his people, allowed them to roast at the presbytery fire.

Abigail Adams, in a letter to John Adams, 1776
""Special legislation for woman has placed us in a most anomalous position. Women invested with the rights of citizens in one section—voters, jurors, office-holders—crossing an imaginary line, are subjects in the next. In some States, a married woman may hold property and transact business in her own name; in others, her earnings belong to her husband. In some States, a woman may testify against her husband, sue and be sued in the courts; in others, she has no redress in case of damage to person, property, or character. In case of divorce on account of adultery in the husband, the innocent wife is held to possess no right to children or property, unless by special decree of the court. But in no State of the Union has the wife the right to her own person, or to any part of the joint earnings of the co-partnership during the life of her husband. In some States women may enter the law schools and practice in the courts; in others they are forbidden. In some universities girls enjoy equal educational advantages with boys, while many of the proudest institutions in the land deny them admittance, though the sons of China, Japan and Africa are welcomed there.

The Slave Trade
All of you [soldiers], are summoned . . . to hunt the idolatrous Koholanes [a pejorative word for ""black Africans""]. . . . The soldiery divided themselves into two companies . . . with orders to attack places without defenses and to carry off the inhabitants as well as seizing all peasants busy cultivating their fields. . . . Whilst waiting for the return of the companies despatched to hunt Negroes, we went every day to the slave market where we bought at the following prices:
A Negro with beard………………10 or 15,000 cowries.
They are not considered as merchandise since one has little chance of preventing them from escaping.
An adult Negress………………..10 or 15,000 cowries for the same reasons
An adolescent Negro………………….30,000 cowries
A young Negress ……………………50–60,000 cowries
The price varies according to whether she is more or less beautiful.
A male Negro child……………………..45,000 cowries
A female Negro child ……………………….35–40,000 cowries
Finally, our caravan which had set out from Algeria with sixty-four camels and only sixteen persons, was now augmented by four hundred slaves, of whom three hundred were women. . . . It was at this point that suddenly a confused noise of cries and sobs passed from one group of slaves to another and reached our own. . . . Some rolled on the ground, clung to bushes and absolutely refused to walk. . . . They could only be got up with mighty lashes of the whip and by rendering them completely bloody.

When two charged particles are released from rest, they will experience a force due to the electric field. This force will cause them to accelerate. 

The direction of the force will depend on the sign of the charge of the particles.

First, we need to calculate the concentration of the acid in the solution. We can do this by using the molar mass of the acid and the amount of acid that was dissolved in the solution. 

Molar mass of acid = 248 g/mol
Amount of acid = 0.0050 mol

Concentration of acid = 0.0050 mol/0.500 L = 0.01 mol/L

Now, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to calculate the pKa of the acid. 

pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])

3.89 = pKa + log(0.01/[HA])

pKa = 3.89 - log(0.01/[HA])

pKa = 3.89 - (-2.00)

Nonviolent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and foster such a tension that a community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue. It seeks so to dramatize the issue that it can no longer be ignored. My citing the creation of tension as part of the work of the nonviolent-resister may sound rather shocking. But I must confess that I am not afraid of the word ""tension."" I have earnestly opposed violent tension, but there is a type of constructive, nonviolent tension which is necessary for growth. Just as Socrates felt that it was necessary to create a tension in the mind so that individuals could rise from the bondage of myths and half-truths to the unfettered realm of creative analysis and objective appraisal, we must we see the need for nonviolent gadflies to create the kind of tension in society that will help men rise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism to the majestic heights of understanding and brotherhood.""

""We, men and women, who hereby constitute ourselves as the National Organization for Women, believe that the time has come for a new movement toward true equality for all women in America, and toward a fully equal partnership of the sexes, as part of the world-wide revolution of human rights now taking place within and beyond our national borders.
The purpose of NOW is to take action to bring women into full participation in the mainstream of American society now, exercising all the privileges and responsibilities thereof in truly equal partnership with men.
We believe the time has come to move beyond the abstract argument, discussion and symposia over the status and special nature of women which has raged in America in recent years; the time has come to confront, with concrete action, the conditions that now prevent women from enjoying the equality of opportunity and freedom of which is their right, as individual Americans, and as human beings.""

""The long-term goal of Gay Liberation, which inevitably brings us into conflict with the institutionalized sexism of this society, is to rid society of the gender-role system which is at the root of our oppression. This can only be achieved by eliminating the social pressures on men and women to conform to narrowly defined gender roles. It is particularly important that children and young people be encouraged to develop their own talents and interests and to express their own individuality rather than act out stereotyped parts alien to their nature.
As we cannot carry out this revolutionary change alone, and as the abolition of gender rotes is also a necessary condition of women`s liberation, we will work to form a strategic alliance with the women`s liberation movement, aiming to develop our ideas and our practice in close inter-relation. In order to build this alliance, the brothers in gay liberation will have to be prepared to sacrifice that degree of male chauvinism and male privilege that they still all possess.""

Questions to the passage below, an account given to a French officer in Algeria in the 1830s by a member of an Arab slave trade caravan.
The Slave Trade
All of you [soldiers], are summoned . . . to hunt the idolatrous Koholanes [a pejorative word for ""black Africans""]. . . . The soldiery divided themselves into two companies . . . with orders to attack places without defenses and to carry off the inhabitants as well as seizing all peasants busy cultivating their fields. . . . Whilst waiting for the return of the companies despatched to hunt Negroes, we went every day to the slave market where we bought at the following prices:
A Negro with beard………………10 or 15,000 cowries.
They are not considered as merchandise since one has little chance of preventing them from escaping.
An adult Negress………………..10 or 15,000 cowries for the same reasons
An adolescent Negro………………….30,000 cowries
A young Negress ……………………50–60,000 cowries
The price varies according to whether she is more or less beautiful.
A male Negro child……………………..45,000 cowries
A female Negro child ……………………….35–40,000 cowries
Finally, our caravan which had set out from Algeria with sixty-four camels and only sixteen persons, was now augmented by four hundred slaves, of whom three hundred were women. . . . It was at this point that suddenly a confused noise of cries and sobs passed from one group of slaves to another and reached our own. . . . Some rolled on the ground, clung to bushes and absolutely refused to walk. . . . They could only be got up with mighty lashes of the whip and by rendering them completely bloody.

In some States, a married woman may hold property and transact business in her own name; in others, her earnings belong to her husband. In some States, a woman may testify against her husband, sue and be sued in the courts; in others, she has no redress in case of damage to person, property, or character. In case of divorce on account of adultery in the husband, the innocent wife is held to possess no right to children or property, unless by special decree of the court. But in no State of the Union has the wife the right to her own person, or to any part of the joint earnings of the co-partnership during the life of her husband. In some States women may enter the law schools and practice in the courts; in others they are forbidden.

Government, like dress, is the badge of lost innocence; the palaces of kings are built on the ruins of the bowers of paradise. For were the impulses of conscience clear, uniform, and irresistibly obeyed, man would need no other lawgiver; but that not being the case, he finds it necessary to surrender up a part of his property to furnish means for the protection of the rest; and this he is induced to do by the same prudence which in every other case advises him out of two evils to choose the least.

The distress and misery that oppress all the Christian estates, more especially in Germany, have led not only myself, but every one else, to cry aloud and to ask for help. . . . These Romanists have, with great adroitness, drawn three walls around themselves, with which they have hitherto protected themselves, so that no one could reform them, whereby all Christendom has fallen terribly. . . .

Let us now consider the matters which should be treated in the councils, and with which popes, cardinals, bishops, and all learned men should occupy themselves day and night. . . . It is a distressing and terrible thing to see that the head of Christendom, who boasts of being the vicar of Christ and the successor of St. Peter, lives in a worldly pomp that no king or emperor can equal. What is the use in Christendom of the people called ""cardinals""? I will tell you. In Italy and Germany there are many rich convents, endowments, fiefs, and benefices, and as the best way of getting these into the hands of Rome, they created cardinals, and gave them the sees, convents, and prelacies, and thus destroyed the service of God.

The Navigation Acts of 1651 were designed to limit the prospects of the Dutch in the seventeenth century by restricting the import of goods from Europe, Asia, Africa, and America to ships that belonged to the people of England. This would have had a negative impact on the Dutch economy, as their dominance of overseas trade quickly ended.

The North Atlantic Treaty was signed by its participating countries in 1949. This was after World War II, so the opportunity to re-take colonies lost after World War II would not be a factor. 

The treaty itself outlines the purpose of the alliance, which is to settle international disputes peacefully, strengthen free institutions, eliminate conflict in international economic policies, and to provide mutual aid and assistance in the event of an armed attack.

George Washington expressed his opinion that the US needed a coercive power to ensure that people would carry out measures that were best for their own good. He also expressed his concern that people were speaking of a monarchical form of government without horror.

The mutation changed a polar amino acid into a nonpolar amino acid. This means that the charge of the amino acid has changed.

First, we need to calculate the electric field at the point (0, 4 meters). This can be done using Coulomb`s law:

E = kQ/r^2

where k is the Coulomb constant, Q is the charge of the point charge, and r is the distance between the two charges.

Plugging in the values, we get:

E = (8.99 x 10^9 Nm^2/C^2)(1 mC)/(4 m)^2

E = 2.25 x 10^7 N/C

Now, we can calculate the work required to move the charge from (0, 4 meters) to (3 meters, 0). This can be done using the equation:

W = qE

where q is the charge of the particle being moved and E is the electric field.

Plugging in the values, we get:

W = (8 x 10^-6 C)(2.25 x 10^7 N/C)

W = 18 J

An external tax is a duty laid on commodities imported; that duty is added to the first cost and other charges on the commodity, and, when it is offered for sale, makes a part of the price. If the people do not like it at that price, they refuse it; they are not obliged to pay it. But an internal tax is forced from the people without their consent if not laid by their own representatives. The Stamp Act says we shall have no commerce, make no exchange of property with each other, neither purchase nor grant, nor recover debts; we shall neither marry nor make our wills, unless we pay such and such sums; and thus it is intended to extort our money from us or ruin us by the consequence of refusing to pay it.""

First, we need to figure out how much volume the Empire State Building has. We can estimate that each story is about 10 meters tall, so the total height of the building is about 1000 meters. We can also estimate that the building is about 50 meters wide and 50 meters long. That means the total volume of the building is about 25,000,000 cubic meters. 

Now, we need to figure out how much volume a single balloon can hold. We can estimate that a single balloon can hold about 0.1 cubic meters of air. 

Finally, we can calculate the total number of balloons required to fill the Empire State Building. We can do this by dividing the total volume of the building (25,000,000 cubic meters) by the volume of a single balloon (0.1 cubic meters). This gives us a total of 250,000,000 balloons.

The first passage is the Immigration Restriction Act of 1901 (Australia). This law was enacted to place certain restrictions on immigration and to provide for the removal from the Commonwealth of Prohibited Immigrants. 

The second passage is the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 (United States). This law was enacted to suspend the coming of Chinese laborers to the United States and to punish the masters of vessels who knowingly bring Chinese laborers to the United States. 

Both of these laws were enacted in the 1800s. The broad trend from the 1800s that formed the background for the enactment of these laws is European and American colonial domination of India and China.

First, we need to calculate the standard reaction Gibbs free energy (ΔG°) from the equilibrium constant (K). We can use the equation ΔG° = -RT ln K, where R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol K) and T is the temperature (25 °C = 298 K).

Plugging in the values, we get ΔG° = -(8.314 J/mol K)(298 K) ln (2.6 × 10^8) = -4.03 kJ mol-1.

The revolutionary seed had penetrated into every country and spread more or less. It was greatly developed under the régime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.
The monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.
Union between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .
Let them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.
Let them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.
Let them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.
Let them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.

The arrow hits 0.050 m below the center of the target. Neglecting air resistance, what was the initial speed of the arrow?",20 m/s,40 m/s,100 m/s,200 m/s,D,"

First, we need to calculate the time it took for the arrow to reach the target. We can use the equation d = vt, where d is the distance, v is the initial velocity, and t is the time.

d = 20 m
v = ?
t = ?

We can rearrange the equation to solve for t: t = d/v.

Now, we can use the equation y = y0 + v0t + (1/2)at2, where y is the final vertical position, y0 is the initial vertical position, v0 is the initial velocity, a is the acceleration due to gravity, and t is the time.

y = 0.050 m
y0 = 0 m
v0 = ?
a = -9.8 m/s2
t = d/v

We can rearrange the equation to solve for v0: v0 = (y - y0)/(t + (1/2)at2).

The revolutionary seed had penetrated into every country and spread more or less. It was greatly developed under the régime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.
The monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.
Union between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .
Let them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.
Let them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.
Let them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.

Is it anything less than a miracle if she is guilty of nothing less than the ""early and improvident marriage,"" against which moralists exclaim as one of the prolific causes of the distresses of the poor? Almost any door might seem to offer a welcome escape from such slavery as this. ""I feel so much healthier since I got three square meals a day,"" said a lodger in one of the Girls` Homes. Two young sewing-girls came in seeking domestic service, so that they might get enough to eat. They had been only half-fed for some time, and starvation had driven them to the one door at which the pride of the American-born girl will not permit her to knock, though poverty be the price of her independence.

Abigail Adams, in a letter to John Adams, 1776
""Special legislation for woman has placed us in a most anomalous position. Women invested with the rights of citizens in one section—voters, jurors, office-holders—crossing an imaginary line, are subjects in the next. In some States, a married woman may hold property and transact business in her own name; in others, her earnings belong to her husband. In some States, a woman may testify against her husband, sue and be sued in the courts; in others, she has no redress in case of damage to person, property, or character. In case of divorce on account of adultery in the husband, the innocent wife is held to possess no right to children or property, unless by special decree of the court. But in no State of the Union has the wife the right to her own person, or to any part of the joint earnings of the co-partnership during the life of her husband. In some States women may enter the law schools and practice in the courts; in others they are forbidden. In some universities girls enjoy equal educational advantages with boys, while many of the proudest institutions in the land deny them admittance, though the sons of China, Japan and Africa are welcomed there. But the privileges already granted in the several States are by no means secure.""

First, we need to calculate the standard reaction Gibbs free energy (ΔG°) from the equilibrium constant (K). We can use the equation ΔG° = -RT ln K, where R is the gas constant (8.314 J/mol K) and T is the temperature (25 °C = 298 K).

Plugging in the values, we get ΔG° = -(8.314 J/mol K)(298 K) ln (2.6 × 10^8) = -4.03 kJ mol-1.

First, we need to calculate the interquartile range (IQR). The IQR is the difference between the 75th percentile and the 25th percentile. 

Next, we need to calculate the 75th percentile and the 25th percentile. To do this, we need to calculate the z-score for each percentile. 

The z-score for the 75th percentile is 1.34. The z-score for the 25th percentile is -1.34. 

Now, we can calculate the 75th percentile and the 25th percentile. 

75th percentile = mean + (z-score * standard deviation) 
75th percentile = 640,000 + (1.34 * 18,000) 
75th percentile = 658,000 

25th percentile = mean + (z-score * standard deviation) 
25th percentile = 640,000 + (-1.34 * 18,000) 
25th percentile = 622,000

In some States, a married woman may hold property and transact business in her own name; in others, her earnings belong to her husband. In some States, a woman may testify against her husband, sue and be sued in the courts; in others, she has no redress in case of damage to person, property, or character. In case of divorce on account of adultery in the husband, the innocent wife is held to possess no right to children or property, unless by special decree of the court. But in no State of the Union has the wife the right to her own person, or to any part of the joint earnings of the co-partnership during the life of her husband. In some States women may enter the law schools and practice in the courts; in others they are forbidden. In some universities girls enjoy equal educational advantages with boys, while many of the proudest institutions in the land deny them admittance, though the sons of China, Japan and Africa are welcomed there.

""The Italian nation has been at last united in our own days, and we all rejoiced in its union. Yet we may be allowed to doubt whether the union was not a little too speedy and a little too thorough. It is surely carrying unity too far to wipe out all traces of the independent being, for most purposes to wipe out the very name, of such a land as Sicily. It jars on our feelings to find that, while Ireland at least forms part of the royal style of its sovereign, Sicily is no longer even a geographical expression. The island realm of Roger has sunk to be seven provinces of the kingdom on the mainland. And there is another result of Italian unity, a result in which we may rejoice without drawbacks, but which still has somewhat of sadness about it as finally ending that great phase of the history of Europe with which we have throughout been dealing. Never were ties with the past so fully snapped as when the army of Italy entered liberated Rome. Of all novelties in European history the greatest was when Rome became the centre of a dominion with acknowledged metes and bounds, the head in short of a local Italian kingdom. ""Rome the capital of Italy"" was a formula which might well gladden our hearts; but it was a formula which formally swept away the œcumenical position, the œcumenical traditions, of Rome&….
But the kingdom of Italy is not an appendage to Rome; Rome is the head of the kingdom. The whole is greater than its part; Rome, by her own free will and by the free will of Italy, has become less than Italy.

President Reagan`s statement was that the federal government was created by the states and the federal government`s role should be limited. 

The Anti-Federalists were a group of people who opposed the ratification of the US Constitution because they believed it gave too much power to the federal government. Therefore, they would have agreed with President Reagan`s statement. 

The Whig Party was a political party in the United States in the 1830s and 1840s that supported the federal government`s role in economic development and infrastructure projects. Therefore, they would not have agreed with President Reagan`s statement. 

The Mugwumps were a group of Republican Party members who supported Grover Cleveland in the 1884 presidential election. They were opposed to the corruption of the Republican Party and supported civil service reform. Therefore, they would not have agreed with President Reagan`s statement. 

The Progressives were a political movement in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that sought to increase government regulation of business and industry. Therefore, they would not have agreed with President Reagan`s statement.

",A baked apple,A raw apple,A raw potato,Apple juice,C,"

Glycaemic index (GI) is a measure of how quickly a food is broken down into glucose and absorbed into the bloodstream. Generally, foods with a lower GI are better for blood sugar control. 

A baked apple will have a higher GI than a raw apple, as baking breaks down the cell walls of the apple, making it easier to digest and absorb.

""You may well ask: ""Why direct action? Why sit-ins, marches and so forth? Isn`t negotiation a better path?"" You are quite right in calling, for negotiation. Indeed, this is the very purpose of direct action. Nonviolent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and foster such a tension that a community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue. It seeks so to dramatize the issue that it can no longer be ignored. My citing the creation of tension as part of the work of the nonviolent-resister may sound rather shocking. But I must confess that I am not afraid of the word ""tension."" I have earnestly opposed violent tension, but there is a type of constructive, nonviolent tension which is necessary for growth. Just as Socrates felt that it was necessary to create a tension in the mind so that individuals could rise from the bondage of myths and half-truths to the unfettered realm of creative analysis and objective appraisal, we must we see the need for nonviolent gadflies to create the kind of tension in society that will help men rise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism to the majestic heights of understanding and brotherhood.""

This can only be achieved by eliminating the social pressures on men and women to conform to narrowly defined gender roles. It is particularly important that children and young people be encouraged to develop their own talents and interests and to express their own individuality rather than act out stereotyped parts alien to their nature.
As we cannot carry out this revolutionary change alone, and as the abolition of gender rotes is also a necessary condition of women`s liberation, we will work to form a strategic alliance with the women`s liberation movement, aiming to develop our ideas and our practice in close inter-relation. In order to build this alliance, the brothers in gay liberation will have to be prepared to sacrifice that degree of male chauvinism and male privilege that they still all possess.""

""The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years, with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants. On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties. Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road. Can the worker-peasant alliance continue to stand in these circumstances? Obviously not! There is no solution to this problem except on a new basis. And that means to bring about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words, it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together. We maintain that this is the only way to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance.""

The median is the middle number when the set is arranged in ascending order, so x and y must be equal. Therefore, x = y = 250.

An external tax is a duty laid on commodities imported; that duty is added to the first cost and other charges on the commodity, and, when it is offered for sale, makes a part of the price. If the people do not like it at that price, they refuse it; they are not obliged to pay it. But an internal tax is forced from the people without their consent if not laid by their own representatives. The Stamp Act says we shall have no commerce, make no exchange of property with each other, neither purchase nor grant, nor recover debts; we shall neither marry nor make our wills, unless we pay such and such sums; and thus it is intended to extort our money from us or ruin us by the consequence of refusing to pay it.""

First, we know that 4% of the population has the disease. This means that 96% of the population does not have the disease. 

Next, we know that the blood test gives a positive reading for 95% of people who have the disease and for 5% of people who do not have the disease. 

Therefore, the probability that a person has the disease, given that they tested positive, is 95% (of the 4% of the population that has the disease) divided by the total number of people who tested positive (95% of the 4% of the population that has the disease plus 5% of the 96% of the population that does not have the disease). 

This means that the probability that a person has the disease, given that they tested positive, is 95% / (95% + 5%) = 0.95 / 1.00 = 0.95.

A competitive market structure is one in which there are many firms producing the same product, and each firm has a small market share. This means that each firm has to compete with the others in order to attract customers. As a result, the price of the product is likely to be lower than it would be in a monopoly, since the firms have to compete with each other to attract customers.

On the other hand, a monopoly is a market structure in which there is only one firm producing the same product. This means that the firm has no competition and can set the price of the product as high as it wants.

Given this information, the correct answer is (A) Price equal to marginal cost. In a competitive market structure, the price of the product is likely to be equal to the marginal cost, since the firms have to compete with each other to attract customers. In a monopoly, however, the price of the product is likely to be higher than the marginal cost, since the firm has no competition and can set the price as high as it wants.",A,high_school_microeconomics,R_1psQ9E2gxp64m3w,rpp,expert,yes,4026.0,Business Administration,2616,'-explain codes - simplify concepts - step by step problem explanation - resume polishing -cover letter draft -research like compiling lists,1,1,1,1,0.0,Economics,Comfortable,1,0,0,1,4,"(5, 10]",-252796768289642610,1,1.0,4.0,1.0,0.5714285714285714,0.5714285714285714

First, we need to figure out how much volume the Empire State Building has. We can estimate that each story is about 10 meters tall, so the total height of the building is about 1000 meters. We can also estimate that the building is about 50 meters wide and 50 meters long. That means the total volume of the building is about 25,000,000 cubic meters. 

Now, we need to figure out how much volume a single balloon can hold. We can estimate that a single balloon can hold about 0.1 cubic meters of air. 

Finally, we can calculate the total number of balloons required to fill the Empire State Building. We can do this by dividing the total volume of the building (25,000,000 cubic meters) by the volume of a single balloon (0.1 cubic meters). This gives us a total of 250,000,000 balloons.

One of the rights which the freeman has always guarded with most jealous care is that of enjoying the rewards of his own industry. Realizing that the power to tax is the power to destroy and that the power to take a certain amount of property or of income is only another way of saying that for a certain proportion of his time a citizen must work for the government, the authority to impose a tax on the people has been most carefully guarded.… A government which lays taxes on the people not required by urgent necessity and sound public policy is not a protector of liberty, but an instrument of tyranny. It condemns the citizen to tyranny. One of the first signs of the breaking down of free government is a disregard by the taxing power of the right of the people to their own property.… Unless the people can enjoy that reasonable security in the possession of their property, which is guaranteed by the Constitution, against unreasonable taxation, freedom is at an end.… With us economy is imperative.

First, we need to calculate the electric field at the point (0, 4 meters). This can be done using Coulomb`s law:

E = kQ/r^2

where k is the Coulomb constant, Q is the charge of the point charge, and r is the distance between the two charges.

E = (8.99 x 10^9 Nm^2/C^2)(1 mC)/(4 m)^2

E = 2.25 x 10^7 N/C

Now, we can calculate the work required to move the charge from (0, 4 meters) to (3 meters, 0). This can be done using the equation:

W = qE

where q is the charge of the particle being moved and E is the electric field.

Plugging in the values, we get:

That day the Reverend Xuanzang was chosen from among all the monks. He had been a monk from infancy, and ever since birth he had eaten vegetarian food and observed the prohibitions. His maternal grandfather was an imperial commander, Yin Kaishan. His father Chen Guangrui had come top in the Palace Examination and had been appointed a grand secretary in the Imperial Library. Xuanzang, however, had no interest in honour and glory, and his only joy was to cultivate Nirvana. His virtue was great; of the thousand sutras and ten thousand holy books there was not a single one that he did not know.
…
He looked to the West and prayed, ""I am the believer Chen Xuanzang sent on imperial orders to fetch the scriptures. If I am fated to have a disciple, may I be able to unseal the golden words and release the divine Monkey King to come with me to the Vulture Peak. If I am not fated to have a disciple, and this monkey is an evil monster who has deceived me and will do me no good, then may I be unable to remove the seal."" When he had prayed he bowed again.

The following quote is from Voltaire in response to the 1755 Lisbon earthquake.
My dear sir, nature is very cruel. One would find it hard to imagine how the laws of movement cause such frightful disasters in the best of possible worlds. A hundred thousand ants, our fellows, crushed all at once in our ant-hill, and half of them perishing, no doubt in unspeakable agony, beneath the wreckage from which they cannot be drawn. Families ruined all over Europe, the fortune of a hundred businessmen, your compatriots, swallowed up in the ruins of Lisbon. What a wretched gamble is the game of human life! What will the preachers say, especially if the palace of the Inquisition is still standing? I flatter myself that at least the reverend father inquisitors have been crushed like others. That ought to teach men not to persecute each other, for while a few holy scoundrels burn a few fanatics, the earth swallows up one and all.

",1250 kcal/day,1350 kcal/day,1525 kcal/day,1800 kcal/day,B,"

First, we need to calculate the woman`s basal metabolic rate (BMR). This is the amount of energy needed to keep the body functioning at rest. The formula for calculating BMR is:

BMR = 10 x weight (kg) + 6.25 x height (cm) - 5 x age (years) + 5

For this woman, the BMR would be:

BMR = 10 x 63 + 6.25 x - 5 x 43 + 5
     = 630 + -215 + 5
     = 420 kcal/day

Now, we need to multiply the BMR by an activity factor to get the total energy need. Since the woman is sedentary, we will use an activity factor of 1.2.

Total energy need = BMR x activity factor
                  = 420 x 1.2
                  = 504 kcal/day

""In 1500 that work appeared which Erasmus had written after his misfortune at Dover, and had dedicated to Mountjoy, the Adagiorum Collectanea. It was a collection of about eight hundred proverbial sayings drawn from the Latin authors of antiquity and elucidated for the use of those who aspired to write an elegant Latin style. In the dedication Erasmus pointed out the profit an author may derive, both in ornamenting his style and in strengthening his argumentation, from having at his disposal a good supply of sentences hallowed by their antiquity. He proposes to offer such a help to his readers. What he actually gave was much more. He familiarized a much wider circle than the earlier humanists had reached with the spirit of antiquity.
Until this time the humanists had, to some extent, monopolized the treasures of classic culture, in order to parade their knowledge of which the multitude remained destitute, and so to become strange prodigies of learning and elegance. With his irresistible need of teaching and his sincere love for humanity and its general culture, Erasmus introduced the classic spirit, in so far as it could be reflected in the soul of a sixteenth-century Christian, among the people. Not he alone; but none more extensively and more effectively. Not among all the people, it is true, for by writing in Latin he limited his direct influence to the educated classes, which in those days were the upper classes.
Erasmus made current the classic spirit. Humanism ceased to be the exclusive privilege of a few. According to Beatus Rhenanus he had been reproached by some humanists, when about to publish the Adagia, for divulging the mysteries of their craft. But he desired that the book of antiquity should be open to all.""

Randomised controlled trials are used to test the effectiveness of a treatment or intervention, so this is not the most reliable type of observational study for investigating the link between diet and cancer. 

Prospective studies are used to observe the effects of a certain factor over a period of time, so this is also not the most reliable type of observational study for investigating the link between diet and cancer. 

Ecological studies are used to compare the effects of a certain factor between different populations, so this is also not the most reliable type of observational study for investigating the link between diet and cancer.

First, we need to calculate the difference between the two decibel levels: 140 dB - 110 dB = 30 dB. 

Next, we need to calculate the percentage of noise being blocked. To do this, we divide the difference (30 dB) by the original decibel level (140 dB): 30 dB / 140 dB = 0.214. 

Finally, we need to convert this decimal into a percentage. To do this, we multiply the decimal by 100: 0.214 x 100 = 21.40%.

In the Manufacture of Woollens, the Scribbling Mill, the Spinning Frame, and the Fly Shuttle, have reduced manual Labour nearly One third, and each of them at its-first Introduction carried an Alarm to the Work People, yet each has contributed to advance the Wages and to increase the Trade, so that if an Attempt was now made to deprive us of the Use of them, there is no Doubt, but every Person engaged in the Business, would exert himself to defend them.

The right of judging, in such cases, is an essential attribute of sovereignty, of which the States cannot be divested without losing their sovereignty itself, and being reduced to a subordinate corporate condition. In fact, to divide power, and to give to one of the parties the exclusive right of judging of the portion allotted to each, is, in reality, not to divide it at all; and to reserve such exclusive right to the General Government (it matters not by what department to be exercised), is to convert it, in fact, into a great consolidated government, with unlimited powers, and to divest the States, in reality, of all their rights, It is impossible to understand the force of terms, and to deny so plain a conclusion.""

First, we need to figure out how much volume the Empire State Building has. We can estimate that each story is about 10 meters tall, so the total height of the building is about 1000 meters. We can also estimate that the building is about 50 meters wide and 50 meters long. That means the total volume of the building is about 25,000,000 cubic meters. 

Now, we need to figure out how much volume a single balloon can hold. We can estimate that a single balloon can hold about 0.1 cubic meters of air. 

Finally, we can calculate the total number of balloons required to fill the Empire State Building. We can do this by dividing the total volume of the building (25,000,000 cubic meters) by the volume of a single balloon (0.1 cubic meters). This gives us a total of 250,000,000 balloons.

REMAIN NON-VIOLENT
The following message was sent by Mahatma Gandhi from Waltair:—
Maulana Mohamed AH was arrested at Waltair under sections 107 and 108 to be called upon to give security, to be of good behaviour for one year. The place and date of trial is unknown.
The Begum Saheba and Mr. Hayat were permitted to see him after arrest.
He and I were going to address a meeting outside the station. He was arrested. I continued going to the meeting and addressed them. There is no cause for sorrow, but every cause for congratulation. There should be no hartal. Perfect peace and calmness should be observed. I regard the arrest as a prelude to Swaraj and the redress of the Khilafat and the Punjab wrongs, if we can remain non-violent. Retain Hindu-Muslim Unity despite the madness of some Moplahs, and fulfil the Swadeshi programme.
I hope every Indian, man or woman, will completely boycott foreign cloth and take up spinning or weaving during every spare minute.
By striving like the Maulana, be insistent on religious and national rights.
Let us earn imprisonment. I am conscious of the Maulana`s innocence and I am sure the imprisonment of the innocent will enable the nation to reach the cherished goal.""

Read the following governmental report.
Of the 450 sick persons whom the inhabitants were unable to relieve, 200 were turned out, and these we saw die one by one as they lay on the roadside. A large number still remain, and to each of them it is only possible to dole out the least scrap of bread. We only give bread to those who would otherwise die. The staple dish here consists of mice, which the inhabitants hunt, so desperate are they from hunger. They devour roots which the animals cannot eat; one can, in fact, not put into words the things one sees. . . . This narrative, far from exaggerating, rather understates the horror of the case, for it does not record the hundredth part of the misery in this district. Those who have not witnessed it with their own eyes cannot imagine how great it is. Not a day passes but at least 200 people die of famine in the two provinces. We certify to having ourselves seen herds, not of cattle, but of men and women, wandering about the fields between Rheims and Rhétel, turning up the earth like pigs to find a few roots; and as they can only find rotten ones, and not half enough of them, they become so weak that they have not strength left to seek food. The parish priest at Boult, whose letter we enclose, tells us he has buried three of his parishioners who died of hunger. The rest subsisted on chopped straw mixed with earth, of which they composed a food which cannot be called bread. Other persons in the same place lived on the bodies of animals which had died of disease, and which the curé, otherwise unable to help his people, allowed them to roast at the presbytery fire.

One of the rights which the freeman has always guarded with most jealous care is that of enjoying the rewards of his own industry. Realizing that the power to tax is the power to destroy and that the power to take a certain amount of property or of income is only another way of saying that for a certain proportion of his time a citizen must work for the government, the authority to impose a tax on the people has been most carefully guarded.… A government which lays taxes on the people not required by urgent necessity and sound public policy is not a protector of liberty, but an instrument of tyranny. It condemns the citizen to tyranny. One of the first signs of the breaking down of free government is a disregard by the taxing power of the right of the people to their own property.… Unless the people can enjoy that reasonable security in the possession of their property, which is guaranteed by the Constitution, against unreasonable taxation, freedom is at an end.… With us economy is imperative.

The buoyant force on the balloon is determined by the volume of air displaced by the balloon. Since the balloon is spherical, the volume of air displaced is proportional to the cube of the radius. Therefore, if the radius is doubled, the volume of air displaced will increase by a factor of 8. This means that the buoyant force on the balloon will increase by a factor of 8.

""The Italian nation has been at last united in our own days, and we all rejoiced in its union. Yet we may be allowed to doubt whether the union was not a little too speedy and a little too thorough. It is surely carrying unity too far to wipe out all traces of the independent being, for most purposes to wipe out the very name, of such a land as Sicily. It jars on our feelings to find that, while Ireland at least forms part of the royal style of its sovereign, Sicily is no longer even a geographical expression. The island realm of Roger has sunk to be seven provinces of the kingdom on the mainland. And there is another result of Italian unity, a result in which we may rejoice without drawbacks, but which still has somewhat of sadness about it as finally ending that great phase of the history of Europe with which we have throughout been dealing. Never were ties with the past so fully snapped as when the army of Italy entered liberated Rome. Of all novelties in European history the greatest was when Rome became the centre of a dominion with acknowledged metes and bounds, the head in short of a local Italian kingdom. ""Rome the capital of Italy"" was a formula which might well gladden our hearts; but it was a formula which formally swept away the œcumenical position, the œcumenical traditions, of Rome&….
But the kingdom of Italy is not an appendage to Rome; Rome is the head of the kingdom. The whole is greater than its part; Rome, by her own free will and by the free will of Italy, has become less than Italy.

""In 1500 that work appeared which Erasmus had written after his misfortune at Dover, and had dedicated to Mountjoy, the Adagiorum Collectanea. It was a collection of about eight hundred proverbial sayings drawn from the Latin authors of antiquity and elucidated for the use of those who aspired to write an elegant Latin style. In the dedication Erasmus pointed out the profit an author may derive, both in ornamenting his style and in strengthening his argumentation, from having at his disposal a good supply of sentences hallowed by their antiquity. He proposes to offer such a help to his readers. What he actually gave was much more. He familiarized a much wider circle than the earlier humanists had reached with the spirit of antiquity.
Until this time the humanists had, to some extent, monopolized the treasures of classic culture, in order to parade their knowledge of which the multitude remained destitute, and so to become strange prodigies of learning and elegance. With his irresistible need of teaching and his sincere love for humanity and its general culture, Erasmus introduced the classic spirit, in so far as it could be reflected in the soul of a sixteenth-century Christian, among the people. Not he alone; but none more extensively and more effectively. Not among all the people, it is true, for by writing in Latin he limited his direct influence to the educated classes, which in those days were the upper classes.
Erasmus made current the classic spirit. Humanism ceased to be the exclusive privilege of a few. According to Beatus Rhenanus he had been reproached by some humanists, when about to publish the Adagia, for divulging the mysteries of their craft. But he desired that the book of antiquity should be open to all.""

The North Atlantic Treaty was signed by its participating countries in 1949. This was after World War II, so the opportunity to re-take colonies lost after World War II would not be a factor. 

The treaty itself outlines the purpose of the alliance, which is to settle international disputes peacefully, strengthen free institutions, eliminate conflict in international economic policies, and to provide mutual aid and assistance in the event of an armed attack.

An external tax is a duty laid on commodities imported; that duty is added to the first cost and other charges on the commodity, and, when it is offered for sale, makes a part of the price. If the people do not like it at that price, they refuse it; they are not obliged to pay it. But an internal tax is forced from the people without their consent if not laid by their own representatives. The Stamp Act says we shall have no commerce, make no exchange of property with each other, neither purchase nor grant, nor recover debts; we shall neither marry nor make our wills, unless we pay such and such sums; and thus it is intended to extort our money from us or ruin us by the consequence of refusing to pay it.""

The Slave Trade
All of you [soldiers], are summoned . . . to hunt the idolatrous Koholanes [a pejorative word for ""black Africans""]. . . . The soldiery divided themselves into two companies . . . with orders to attack places without defenses and to carry off the inhabitants as well as seizing all peasants busy cultivating their fields. . . . Whilst waiting for the return of the companies despatched to hunt Negroes, we went every day to the slave market where we bought at the following prices:
A Negro with beard………………10 or 15,000 cowries.
They are not considered as merchandise since one has little chance of preventing them from escaping.
An adult Negress………………..10 or 15,000 cowries for the same reasons
An adolescent Negro………………….30,000 cowries
A young Negress ……………………50–60,000 cowries
The price varies according to whether she is more or less beautiful.
A male Negro child……………………..45,000 cowries
A female Negro child ……………………….35–40,000 cowries
Finally, our caravan which had set out from Algeria with sixty-four camels and only sixteen persons, was now augmented by four hundred slaves, of whom three hundred were women. . . . It was at this point that suddenly a confused noise of cries and sobs passed from one group of slaves to another and reached our own. . . .

The revolutionary seed had penetrated into every country and spread more or less. It was greatly developed under the régime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.
The monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.
Union between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .
Let them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.
Let them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.
Let them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.

The natural world can be studied through empirical data, which means data that is collected through observation and experimentation.

The Federal Reserve is an independent government agency that sets monetary policy. It does this by manipulating the money supply, which affects the cost of borrowing and the availability of credit. 

The most likely cause of a decrease in private investment as a result of an action by the Federal Reserve is (B) Lowering of the discount rate.

The distress and misery that oppress all the Christian estates, more especially in Germany, have led not only myself, but every one else, to cry aloud and to ask for help. . . .

That the Temporal Power Has no Jurisdiction over the Spirituality . . . That No One May Interpret the Scriptures but the Pope . . . That No One May Call a Council but the Pope. . . . Let us now consider the matters which should be treated in the councils, and with which popes, cardinals, bishops, and all learned men should occupy themselves day and night. . . . It is a distressing and terrible thing to see that the head of Christendom, who boasts of being the vicar of Christ and the successor of St. Peter, lives in a worldly pomp that no king or emperor can equal. What is the use in Christendom of the people called ""cardinals""? I will tell you. In Italy and Germany there are many rich convents, endowments, fiefs, and benefices, and as the best way of getting these into the hands of Rome, they created cardinals, and gave them the sees, convents, and prelacies, and thus destroyed the service of God.

The following quote is from Voltaire in response to the 1755 Lisbon earthquake.
My dear sir, nature is very cruel. One would find it hard to imagine how the laws of movement cause such frightful disasters in the best of possible worlds. A hundred thousand ants, our fellows, crushed all at once in our ant-hill, and half of them perishing, no doubt in unspeakable agony, beneath the wreckage from which they cannot be drawn. Families ruined all over Europe, the fortune of a hundred businessmen, your compatriots, swallowed up in the ruins of Lisbon. What a wretched gamble is the game of human life! What will the preachers say, especially if the palace of the Inquisition is still standing? I flatter myself that at least the reverend father inquisitors have been crushed like others. That ought to teach men not to persecute each other, for while a few holy scoundrels burn a few fanatics, the earth swallows up one and all.

Apart from the desire to produce beautiful things, the leading passion of my life has been and is hatred of modern civilization. What shall I say of it now, when the words are put into my mouth, my hope of its destruction—what shall I say of its supplanting by Socialism?
What shall I say concerning its mastery of and its waste of mechanical power, its commonwealth so poor, its enemies of the commonwealth so rich, its stupendous organization—for the misery of life! Its contempt of simple pleasures which everyone could enjoy but for its folly? Its eyeless vulgarity which has destroyed art, the one certain solace of labor? All this I felt then as now, but I did not know why it was so. The hope of the past times was gone, the struggles of mankind for many ages had produced nothing but this sordid, aimless, ugly confusion; the immediate future seemed to me likely to intensify all the present evils by sweeping away the last survivals of the days before the dull squalor of civilization had settled down on the world.
This was a bad lookout indeed, and, if I may mention myself as a personality and not as a mere type, especially so to a man of my disposition, careless of metaphysics and religion, as well as of scientific analysis, but with a deep love of the earth and the life on it, and a passion for the history of the past of mankind.

""You may well ask: ""Why direct action? Why sit-ins, marches and so forth? Isn`t negotiation a better path?"" You are quite right in calling, for negotiation. Indeed, this is the very purpose of direct action. Nonviolent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and foster such a tension that a community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue. It seeks so to dramatize the issue that it can no longer be ignored. My citing the creation of tension as part of the work of the nonviolent-resister may sound rather shocking. But I must confess that I am not afraid of the word ""tension."" I have earnestly opposed violent tension, but there is a type of constructive, nonviolent tension which is necessary for growth. Just as Socrates felt that it was necessary to create a tension in the mind so that individuals could rise from the bondage of myths and half-truths to the unfettered realm of creative analysis and objective appraisal, we must we see the need for nonviolent gadflies to create the kind of tension in society that will help men rise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism to the majestic heights of understanding and brotherhood.""

""The long-term goal of Gay Liberation, which inevitably brings us into conflict with the institutionalized sexism of this society, is to rid society of the gender-role system which is at the root of our oppression. This can only be achieved by eliminating the social pressures on men and women to conform to narrowly defined gender roles. It is particularly important that children and young people be encouraged to develop their own talents and interests and to express their own individuality rather than act out stereotyped parts alien to their nature.
As we cannot carry out this revolutionary change alone, and as the abolition of gender rotes is also a necessary condition of women`s liberation, we will work to form a strategic alliance with the women`s liberation movement, aiming to develop our ideas and our practice in close inter-relation. In order to build this alliance, the brothers in gay liberation will have to be prepared to sacrifice that degree of male chauvinism and male privilege that they still all possess.""

First, we need to calculate the electric field at the point (0, 4 meters). This can be done using Coulomb`s law:

E = kQ/r^2

where k is the Coulomb constant, Q is the charge of the point charge, and r is the distance between the two charges.

W = qE

The range is the difference between the largest and smallest values, so the smallest value must be 200 - 50 = 150. 

The mean is the average of all the numbers, so we can calculate it by adding all the numbers together and dividing by 4. 150 + 200 + x + y = 850, so x + y = 500. 

The median is the middle number when the set is arranged in ascending order, so x and y must be equal. Therefore, x = y = 250.

If civilized education developed in every child its natural inclinations, we should see nearly all rich children enamored of various very plebeian occupations, such as that of the mason, the carpenter, the smith, the saddler. I have instanced Louis the XVI, who loved the trade of locksmith; an Infanta of Spain preferred that of shoemaker; a certain king of Denmark gratified himself by manufacturing syringes; the former king of Naples loved to sell the fish he had caught in the market-place himself; the prince of Parma, whom Condillac had trained in metaphysical subtitles, in the understanding of intuition, of cognition, had no taste but for the occupation of church-warden and lay-brother.
The great majority of wealthy children would follow these plebeian tastes, if civilized education did not oppose the development of them; and if the filthiness of the workshops and the coarseness of the workmen did not arouse a repugnance stronger than the attraction. What child of a prince is there who has no taste for one of the four occupations I have just mentioned, that of mason, carpenter, smith, saddler, and who would not advance in them if he beheld from an early age the work carried on in blight workshops, by refined people, who would always arrange a miniature workshop for children, with little implements and light labor?

Which of the following best describes the outcome of the Navigation Acts of 1651?","They served as a catalyst for the growth of English shipping and overseas trade, but did little to limit the prospects of the Dutch in the seventeenth century.",They brought about almost immediate hardships for the Dutch economy as their dominance of overseas trade quickly ended.,They were rescinded during the restoration of the Stuarts as they sought normal diplomatic relations with the Dutch so not as to need Parliament`s financial support for war.,"They led to nearly a century of recurrent war between England and the Netherlands, which would not end until after American independence.",A,"
The Navigation Acts of 1651 were designed to limit the prospects of the Dutch in the seventeenth century by restricting the import of goods from Europe, Asia, Africa, and America to ships that belonged to the people of England. This would have had a negative impact on the Dutch economy, as their dominance of overseas trade quickly ended.

First, we need to determine the order of the reaction. To do this, we need to look at the equation and determine how many molecules of each reactant are involved in the reaction. In this case, we can see that two molecules of A and one molecule of B are involved in the reaction. Therefore, the reaction is second order with respect to A and first order with respect to B. 

Now, we can determine the rate law. The rate law is an equation that describes how the rate of a reaction is affected by the concentrations of the reactants. In this case, the rate law would be k[A]2[B], where k is the rate constant.

In some States, a woman may testify against her husband, sue and be sued in the courts; in others, she has no redress in case of damage to person, property, or character. In case of divorce on account of adultery in the husband, the innocent wife is held to possess no right to children or property, unless by special decree of the court. But in no State of the Union has the wife the right to her own person, or to any part of the joint earnings of the co-partnership during the life of her husband. In some States women may enter the law schools and practice in the courts; in others they are forbidden.

""The quicksilver mines of Huancavelica are where the poor Indians are so harshly punished, where they are tortured and so many Indians die; it is there that the noble caciques [headmen] of this kingdom are finished off and tortured. The same is true in all the other mines: the silver mines of Potosi [and others]….The owners and stewards of the mines, whether Spaniards, mestizos, or Indians, are such tyrants, with no fear of God or Justice, because they are not audited and are not inspected twice a year….
And they are not paid for the labor of traveling to and from the mines or for the time they spend at the mines. The Indians, under the pretext of mining chores, are made to spend their workdays herding cattle and conveying goods; they are sent off to the plains, and the Indians die. These Indians are not paid for their labor, and their work is kept hidden.
And [the mine owners] keep Indian cooking women in their residences; they use cooking as a pretext for taking concubines….And they oblige the Indians to accept corn or meat or chicha [corn beer]…at their own expense, and they deduct the price from their labor and their workdays. In this way, the Indians end up very poor and deep in debt, and they have no way to pay their tribute.
There is no remedy for all this, because any [colonial official] who enters comes to an agreement with the mine owners, and all the owners join forces in bribing him….Even the protector of the Indians is useless;…he [does not] warn Your Majesty or your royal Audiencia [court] about the harms done to the poor Indians.""

",1250 kcal/day,1350 kcal/day,1525 kcal/day,1800 kcal/day,B,"

First, we need to calculate the woman`s basal metabolic rate (BMR). This is the amount of energy needed to keep the body functioning at rest. The formula for calculating BMR is:

BMR = 10 x weight (kg) + 6.25 x height (cm) - 5 x age (years) + 5

For this woman, the BMR would be:

BMR = 10 x 63 + 6.25 x - 5 x 43 + 5
     = 630 + -215 + 5
     = 420 kcal/day

Now, we need to multiply the BMR by an activity factor to get the total energy need. Since the woman is sedentary, we will use an activity factor of 1.2.

Total energy need = BMR x activity factor
                  = 420 x 1.2
                  = 504 kcal/day

""The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years, with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants. On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties. Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road. Can the worker-peasant alliance continue to stand in these circumstances? Obviously not! There is no solution to this problem except on a new basis. And that means to bring about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words, it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together.

The millionaires are a product of natural selection, acting on the whole body of men to pick out those who can meet the requirement of certain work to be done. In this respect they are just like the great statesmen, or scientific men, or military men.

A competitive market structure is one in which there are many firms producing the same product, and each firm has a small market share. This means that each firm has to compete with the others in order to attract customers. As a result, the price of the product is likely to be lower than it would be in a monopoly, since the firms have to compete with each other to attract customers.

On the other hand, a monopoly is a market structure in which there is only one firm producing the same product. This means that the firm has no competition and can set the price of the product as high as it wants.

Given this information, the correct answer is (A) Price equal to marginal cost. In a competitive market structure, the price of the product is likely to be equal to the marginal cost, since the firms have to compete with each other to attract customers.

The revolutionary seed had penetrated into every country and spread more or less. It was greatly developed under the régime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.
The monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.
Union between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .
Let them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.

He knows that each student will need to use 0.797 grams of magnesium in the first step of the experiment and 0.892 grams in a later step. He uses front-end estimation with an adjustment to figure out the approximate amount of magnesium needed by each student. What is his estimate?,1.4 g,1.7 g,1.6 g,1.5 g,B,"

Dr. Sperline is using front-end estimation, which means he is rounding the numbers to the nearest whole number. So, 0.797 grams of magnesium becomes 1 gram and 0.892 grams of magnesium becomes 1 gram. 

Now, he needs to adjust his estimate to account for the difference between the rounded numbers and the actual numbers. In this case, the difference is 0.203 grams. 

So, the total amount of magnesium needed by each student is 1 + 1 + 0.203 = 2.203 grams.

President Reagan`s statement was that the federal government was created by the states and the federal government`s role should be limited. 

The Anti-Federalists were a group of people who opposed the ratification of the US Constitution because they believed it gave too much power to the federal government. Therefore, they would have agreed with President Reagan`s statement. 

The Whig Party was a political party in the United States in the 1830s and 1840s that supported the federal government`s role in economic development and infrastructure projects. Therefore, they would not have agreed with President Reagan`s statement. 

The Mugwumps were a group of Republican Party members who supported Grover Cleveland in the 1884 presidential election. They were opposed to the corruption of the Republican Party and supported civil service reform. Therefore, they would not have agreed with President Reagan`s statement. 

The Progressives were a political movement in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that sought to increase government regulation of business and industry. Therefore, they would not have agreed with President Reagan`s statement.

First, we need to calculate the concentration of the acid in the solution. We can do this by using the molar mass of the acid and the amount of acid that was dissolved in the solution. 

Molar mass of acid = 248 g/mol
Amount of acid = 0.0050 mol

Concentration of acid = 0.0050 mol/0.500 L = 0.01 mol/L

Now, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to calculate the pKa of the acid. 

pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])

3.89 = pKa + log(0.01/[HA])

pKa = 3.89 - log(0.01/[HA])

Which of the following would have most likely agreed with President Reagan`s statement that the federal government was created by the states and the federal government`s role should be limited?",The Anti-Federalists.,The Whig Party.,The Mugwumps.,The Progressives.,A,"

President Reagan`s statement was that the federal government was created by the states and the federal government`s role should be limited. 

The Anti-Federalists were a group of people who opposed the ratification of the US Constitution because they believed it gave too much power to the federal government. Therefore, they would have agreed with President Reagan`s statement. 

The Whig Party was a political party in the United States in the 1830s and 1840s that supported the federal government`s role in economic development and infrastructure projects. Therefore, they would not have agreed with President Reagan`s statement. 

The Mugwumps were a group of Republican Party members who supported Grover Cleveland in the 1884 presidential election. They were opposed to the corruption of the Republican Party and supported civil service reform. Therefore, they would not have agreed with President Reagan`s statement. 

The Progressives were a political movement in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that sought to increase government regulation of business and industry. Therefore, they would not have agreed with President Reagan`s statement.

As with a Commander of the Army, or leader of any enterprise, so it is with the mistress of the house.

Of all of those acquirements, which more particularly belong to the feminine character, there are none which take a higher rank, in our estimation, than such as enter into a knowledge of household duties; for on these are perpetually dependent the happiness, comfort, and well-being of the family.

""In 1500 that work appeared which Erasmus had written after his misfortune at Dover, and had dedicated to Mountjoy, the Adagiorum Collectanea. It was a collection of about eight hundred proverbial sayings drawn from the Latin authors of antiquity and elucidated for the use of those who aspired to write an elegant Latin style. In the dedication Erasmus pointed out the profit an author may derive, both in ornamenting his style and in strengthening his argumentation, from having at his disposal a good supply of sentences hallowed by their antiquity. He proposes to offer such a help to his readers. What he actually gave was much more. He familiarized a much wider circle than the earlier humanists had reached with the spirit of antiquity.
Until this time the humanists had, to some extent, monopolized the treasures of classic culture, in order to parade their knowledge of which the multitude remained destitute, and so to become strange prodigies of learning and elegance. With his irresistible need of teaching and his sincere love for humanity and its general culture, Erasmus introduced the classic spirit, in so far as it could be reflected in the soul of a sixteenth-century Christian, among the people. Not he alone; but none more extensively and more effectively. Not among all the people, it is true, for by writing in Latin he limited his direct influence to the educated classes, which in those days were the upper classes.
Erasmus made current the classic spirit. Humanism ceased to be the exclusive privilege of a few. According to Beatus Rhenanus he had been reproached by some humanists, when about to publish the Adagia, for divulging the mysteries of their craft. But he desired that the book of antiquity should be open to all.""

The passage is about a character, Souvarine, who is in despair over the news he has received about his old companions turning to politics. He had renounced his rank and fortune to go among workmen in the hope of seeing a new society of labour in common. He then talks about a group of hatworkers who won a lottery prize and decided to invest it rather than give it back to the poor.

Patrick Henry was a leader in the American Revolution, which was a fight for independence from Britain. He was also a passionate advocate for liberty and freedom. 

The nineteenth century saw a number of groups fighting for freedom and liberty, including abolitionists, who fought to end slavery, and supporters of Manifest Destiny, who sought to expand the United States. 

However, the group that most directly saw themselves as following in the tradition of Patrick Henry were the Southern secessionists, who sought to secede from the United States in order to preserve their own liberty and freedom.

""You may well ask: ""Why direct action? Why sit-ins, marches and so forth? Isn`t negotiation a better path?"" You are quite right in calling, for negotiation. Indeed, this is the very purpose of direct action. Nonviolent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and foster such a tension that a community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue. It seeks so to dramatize the issue that it can no longer be ignored. My citing the creation of tension as part of the work of the nonviolent-resister may sound rather shocking. But I must confess that I am not afraid of the word ""tension."" I have earnestly opposed violent tension, but there is a type of constructive, nonviolent tension which is necessary for growth. Just as Socrates felt that it was necessary to create a tension in the mind so that individuals could rise from the bondage of myths and half-truths to the unfettered realm of creative analysis and objective appraisal, we must we see the need for nonviolent gadflies to create the kind of tension in society that will help men rise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism to the majestic heights of understanding and brotherhood.""

The purpose of NOW is to take action to bring women into full participation in the mainstream of American society now, exercising all the privileges and responsibilities thereof in truly equal partnership with men.
We believe the time has come to move beyond the abstract argument, discussion and symposia over the status and special nature of women which has raged in America in recent years; the time has come to confront, with concrete action, the conditions that now prevent women from enjoying the equality of opportunity and freedom of which is their right, as individual Americans, and as human beings.""

""The long-term goal of Gay Liberation, which inevitably brings us into conflict with the institutionalized sexism of this society, is to rid society of the gender-role system which is at the root of our oppression. This can only be achieved by eliminating the social pressures on men and women to conform to narrowly defined gender roles. It is particularly important that children and young people be encouraged to develop their own talents and interests and to express their own individuality rather than act out stereotyped parts alien to their nature.
As we cannot carry out this revolutionary change alone, and as the abolition of gender rotes is also a necessary condition of women`s liberation, we will work to form a strategic alliance with the women`s liberation movement, aiming to develop our ideas and our practice in close inter-relation. In order to build this alliance, the brothers in gay liberation will have to be prepared to sacrifice that degree of male chauvinism and male privilege that they still all possess.""

""Society in every state is a blessing, but government even in its best state is but a necessary evil; in its worst state an intolerable one; for when we suffer, or are exposed to the same miseries by a government, which we might expect in a country without government, our calamity is heightened by reflecting that we furnish the means by which we suffer. Government, like dress, is the badge of lost innocence; the palaces of kings are built on the ruins of the bowers of paradise. For were the impulses of conscience clear, uniform, and irresistibly obeyed, man would need no other lawgiver; but that not being the case, he finds it necessary to surrender up a part of his property to furnish means for the protection of the rest; and this he is induced to do by the same prudence which in every other case advises him out of two evils to choose the least. Wherefore, security being the true design and end of government, it unanswerably follows that whatever form thereof appears most likely to ensure it to us, with the least expense and greatest benefit, is preferable to all others.""

For the 176 players on the roster for one season of professional men`s basketball, the third quartile for the total number of offensive rebounds for one season was 143.

First, we need to calculate the probability that a single player had more than 143 offensive rebounds in one season. We can do this by dividing the number of players with more than 143 offensive rebounds (176 - 143 = 33) by the total number of players (176). This gives us a probability of 0.1875.

Next, we need to calculate the probability that at least three of the five players selected had more than 143 offensive rebounds. We can do this by using the binomial probability formula, which is P(X ≥ 3) = 1 - P(X ≤ 2).

Plugging in our values, we get P(X ≥ 3) = 1 - P(X ≤ 2) = 1 - (0.1875)^3 - 3(0.1875)^2(0.8125) - 3(0.1875)(0.8125)^2 - (0.8125)^3 = 0.8965.

""You may well ask: ""Why direct action? Why sit-ins, marches and so forth? Isn`t negotiation a better path?"" You are quite right in calling, for negotiation. Indeed, this is the very purpose of direct action. Nonviolent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and foster such a tension that a community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue. It seeks so to dramatize the issue that it can no longer be ignored. My citing the creation of tension as part of the work of the nonviolent-resister may sound rather shocking. But I must confess that I am not afraid of the word ""tension."" I have earnestly opposed violent tension, but there is a type of constructive, nonviolent tension which is necessary for growth. Just as Socrates felt that it was necessary to create a tension in the mind so that individuals could rise from the bondage of myths and half-truths to the unfettered realm of creative analysis and objective appraisal, we must we see the need for nonviolent gadflies to create the kind of tension in society that will help men rise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism to the majestic heights of understanding and brotherhood.""

The purpose of NOW is to take action to bring women into full participation in the mainstream of American society now, exercising all the privileges and responsibilities thereof in truly equal partnership with men.
We believe the time has come to move beyond the abstract argument, discussion and symposia over the status and special nature of women which has raged in America in recent years; the time has come to confront, with concrete action, the conditions that now prevent women from enjoying the equality of opportunity and freedom of which is their right, as individual Americans, and as human beings.""

""The long-term goal of Gay Liberation, which inevitably brings us into conflict with the institutionalized sexism of this society, is to rid society of the gender-role system which is at the root of our oppression. This can only be achieved by eliminating the social pressures on men and women to conform to narrowly defined gender roles. It is particularly important that children and young people be encouraged to develop their own talents and interests and to express their own individuality rather than act out stereotyped parts alien to their nature.
As we cannot carry out this revolutionary change alone, and as the abolition of gender rotes is also a necessary condition of women`s liberation, we will work to form a strategic alliance with the women`s liberation movement, aiming to develop our ideas and our practice in close inter-relation. In order to build this alliance, the brothers in gay liberation will have to be prepared to sacrifice that degree of male chauvinism and male privilege that they still all possess.""

A competitive market structure is one in which there are many firms producing the same product, and each firm has a small market share. This means that each firm has to compete with the others in order to attract customers. As a result, the price of the product is likely to be lower than it would be in a monopoly, since the firms have to compete with each other to attract customers.

On the other hand, a monopoly is a market structure in which there is only one firm producing the same product. This means that the firm has no competition and can set the price of the product as high as it wants.

Given this information, the correct answer is (A) Price equal to marginal cost. In a competitive market structure, the price of the product is likely to be equal to the marginal cost, since the firms have to compete with each other to attract customers. In a monopoly, however, the price of the product is likely to be higher than the marginal cost, since the firm has no competition and can set the price as high as it wants.",A,high_school_microeconomics,R_1hQYFuFcjUBkfwK,rpp,expert,yes,-125.0,Business Administration,17131,,1,0,0,0,0.8334183933857303,Economics,Neutral,0,0,1,0,1,"(10, 15]",-252796768289642610,1,1.0,8.0,4.0,0.049019607843137254,0.8415841584158416

Read the following excerpt.
If civilized education developed in every child its natural inclinations, we should see nearly all rich children enamored of various very plebeian occupations, such as that of the mason, the carpenter, the smith, the saddler. I have instanced Louis the XVI, who loved the trade of locksmith; an Infanta of Spain preferred that of shoemaker; a certain king of Denmark gratified himself by manufacturing syringes; the former king of Naples loved to sell the fish he had caught in the market-place himself; the prince of Parma, whom Condillac had trained in metaphysical subtitles, in the understanding of intuition, of cognition, had no taste but for the occupation of church-warden and lay-brother.
The great majority of wealthy children would follow these plebeian tastes, if civilized education did not oppose the development of them; and if the filthiness of the workshops and the coarseness of the workmen did not arouse a repugnance stronger than the attraction. What child of a prince is there who has no taste for one of the four occupations I have just mentioned, that of mason, carpenter, smith, saddler, and who would not advance in them if he beheld from an early age the work carried on in blight workshops, by refined people, who would always arrange a miniature workshop for children, with little implements and light labor?

Which of the following groups of intellectuals would Fourier belong to, according to the document above?",Utilitarians,Laissez-faire capitalists,Utopian socialists,Marxist communists,C,"

Fourier is advocating for a type of education that would allow wealthy children to pursue plebeian occupations. This suggests that he is not in favor of the existing social structure, which would make him an opponent of laissez-faire capitalism. 

He is also advocating for a type of education that would allow children to pursue these occupations in a refined and pleasant environment, which suggests that he is in favor of a more utopian society.

""Article 5
The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defence recognised by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.""
North Atlantic Treaty, April 4, 1949
Which of the following best explains why the North Atlantic Treaty was signed by its participating countries?","Because of new enfranchisement laws, citizens demanded their countries join in alliance with other nations.",The threat from opposing states was sufficient enough to join in alliance for the sake of protection.,The opportunity to re-take colonies lost after World War II could only be acted on through military alliance with other countries.,A monopoly on nuclear warfare capabilities compelled nations to join the alliance out of fear.,B,"

The North Atlantic Treaty was signed by its participating countries in 1949. This was after World War II, so the opportunity to re-take colonies lost after World War II would not be a factor. 

The treaty itself outlines the purpose of the alliance, which is to settle international disputes peacefully, strengthen free institutions, eliminate conflict in international economic policies, and to provide mutual aid and assistance in the event of an armed attack. 

Therefore, the best answer is (B) The threat from opposing states was sufficient enough to join in alliance for the sake of protection.",B,high_school_world_history,R_085qWtICtdCIAlX,rpp,expert,yes,-3638.0,Business Administration,17224,I use it to gain a better understanding of concepts that I am unsure of,1,1,1,0,0.0,History,Uncomfortable,-1,1,0,0,3,"(0, 5]",3668816553415959747,1,1.0,2.0,2.0,0.34843205574912894,0.34843205574912894

First, we need to calculate the concentration of the acid in the solution. We can do this by using the molar mass of the acid and the amount of acid that was dissolved in the solution. 

Molar mass of acid = 248 g/mol
Amount of acid = 0.0050 mol

Concentration of acid = 0.0050 mol/0.500 L = 0.01 mol/L

Now, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to calculate the pKa of the acid. 

pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])

3.89 = pKa + log(0.01/[HA])

pKa = 3.89 - log(0.01/[HA])

pKa = 3.89 - (-2.00)

pKa = 5.89

""The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years, with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants. On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties. Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road. Can the worker-peasant alliance continue to stand in these circumstances? Obviously not! There is no solution to this problem except on a new basis. And that means to bring about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words, it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together. We maintain that this is the only way to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance.""

My dear sir, nature is very cruel. One would find it hard to imagine how the laws of movement cause such frightful disasters in the best of possible worlds. A hundred thousand ants, our fellows, crushed all at once in our ant-hill, and half of them perishing, no doubt in unspeakable agony, beneath the wreckage from which they cannot be drawn. Families ruined all over Europe, the fortune of a hundred businessmen, your compatriots, swallowed up in the ruins of Lisbon. What a wretched gamble is the game of human life! What will the preachers say, especially if the palace of the Inquisition is still standing? I flatter myself that at least the reverend father inquisitors have been crushed like others. That ought to teach men not to persecute each other, for while a few holy scoundrels burn a few fanatics, the earth swallows up one and all.

First, we need to calculate the predicted value of ln(y) when x = 7. We can do this by plugging in x = 7 into the equation ln(y) = 3.2 + 0.42x.

ln(y) = 3.2 + 0.42(7)
ln(y) = 5.14

Next, we need to calculate the predicted value of y when x = 7. We can do this by taking the exponential of ln(y).

y = e^(5.14)

The Slave Trade
All of you [soldiers], are summoned . . . to hunt the idolatrous Koholanes [a pejorative word for ""black Africans""]. . . . The soldiery divided themselves into two companies . . . with orders to attack places without defenses and to carry off the inhabitants as well as seizing all peasants busy cultivating their fields. . . . Whilst waiting for the return of the companies despatched to hunt Negroes, we went every day to the slave market where we bought at the following prices:
A Negro with beard………………10 or 15,000 cowries.
They are not considered as merchandise since one has little chance of preventing them from escaping.
An adult Negress………………..10 or 15,000 cowries for the same reasons
An adolescent Negro………………….30,000 cowries
A young Negress ……………………50–60,000 cowries
The price varies according to whether she is more or less beautiful.
A male Negro child……………………..45,000 cowries
A female Negro child ……………………….35–40,000 cowries
Finally, our caravan which had set out from Algeria with sixty-four camels and only sixteen persons, was now augmented by four hundred slaves, of whom three hundred were women. . . . It was at this point that suddenly a confused noise of cries and sobs passed from one group of slaves to another and reached our own. . . . Some rolled on the ground, clung to bushes and absolutely refused to walk. . . . They could only be got up with mighty lashes of the whip and by rendering them completely bloody.

Protein synthesis is the process of creating proteins from amino acids. 

Insulin is a hormone that helps regulate the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. It also helps to transport glucose into cells, which is necessary for energy production. 

Glucagon is a hormone that helps to regulate blood sugar levels by stimulating the breakdown of glycogen into glucose. 

Lysine is an essential amino acid that is necessary for protein synthesis. 

Cortisol is a hormone that is released in response to stress and can have a variety of effects on the body, including increasing blood sugar levels.

The actions taken by Andrew Carnegie that were critiqued in the cartoon reflected the thinking of which of the following concepts?",The Social Gospel.,Survival of the Fittest.,The Gospel of Wealth.,Rugged individualism.,C,"

The cartoon critiqued the actions of Andrew Carnegie. The text of the question does not mention Andrew Carnegie or a cartoon, so this answer choice is not relevant. 

(A) The Social Gospel: This concept is based on the idea that the wealthy should use their resources to help the poor and disadvantaged. The text does not mention the Social Gospel, so this answer choice is not relevant. 

(B) Survival of the Fittest: This concept is based on the idea that the strong will survive and the weak will not. The text does not mention Survival of the Fittest, so this answer choice is not relevant. 

(C) The Gospel of Wealth: This concept is based on the idea that the wealthy should use their resources to benefit society. The text mentions that the women are ""robbed...in marriage, of the custody of their own persons, wages and children,"" which suggests that the wealthy are not using their resources to benefit society. Therefore, this answer choice is the correct one.

Julia`s weekly income is $1000. 

Her marginal propensity to consume is 0.5, which means that she will spend 50% of her income.

The Federal Reserve is an independent government agency that sets monetary policy. It does this by manipulating the money supply, which affects the cost of borrowing and the availability of credit. 

The most likely cause of a decrease in private investment as a result of an action by the Federal Reserve is (B) Lowering of the discount rate.

An external tax is a duty laid on commodities imported; that duty is added to the first cost and other charges on the commodity, and, when it is offered for sale, makes a part of the price. If the people do not like it at that price, they refuse it; they are not obliged to pay it. But an internal tax is forced from the people without their consent if not laid by their own representatives. The Stamp Act says we shall have no commerce, make no exchange of property with each other, neither purchase nor grant, nor recover debts; we shall neither marry nor make our wills, unless we pay such and such sums; and thus it is intended to extort our money from us or ruin us by the consequence of refusing to pay it.""

Next, we know that the blood test gives a positive reading for 95% of people who have the disease and for 5% of people who do not have the disease. 

Therefore, the probability that a person has the disease, given that they tested positive, is 95% (of the 4% of the population that has the disease) divided by the total number of people who tested positive (95% of the 4% of the population that has the disease plus 5% of the 96% of the population that does not have the disease).

Paris has a short memory. If I remain longer doing nothing, I am lost. In this great Babylon one reputation quickly succeeds another. After I have been seen three times at the theatre, I shall not be looked at again. I shall therefore not go very frequently. (diary, 1798)
If the press is not bridled, I shall not remain three days in power. (diary, 1799)
The presence of a general is necessary; he is the head, he is the all in all of an army. It was not the Roman army that conquered Gaul, it was Caesar, it was not the Carthaginians that made the armies of the Roman republic tremble at the very gates of Rome, it was Hannibal. (diary, 1801)
My power proceeds from my reputation, and my reputation from the victories I have won. My power would fall if I were not to support it with more glory and more victories. Conquest has made me what I am; only conquest can maintain me. (diary, 1802)
The revolution in France is over and now there is only one party in France and I shall never allow the newspapers to say anything contrary to my interests. They may publish a few little articles with just a bit of poison in them, but one fine day I shall shut their mouths forever. (diary, 1805)

Of the 450 sick persons whom the inhabitants were unable to relieve, 200 were turned out, and these we saw die one by one as they lay on the roadside. A large number still remain, and to each of them it is only possible to dole out the least scrap of bread. We only give bread to those who would otherwise die. The staple dish here consists of mice, which the inhabitants hunt, so desperate are they from hunger. They devour roots which the animals cannot eat; one can, in fact, not put into words the things one sees. . . . This narrative, far from exaggerating, rather understates the horror of the case, for it does not record the hundredth part of the misery in this district. Those who have not witnessed it with their own eyes cannot imagine how great it is. Not a day passes but at least 200 people die of famine in the two provinces. We certify to having ourselves seen herds, not of cattle, but of men and women, wandering about the fields between Rheims and Rhétel, turning up the earth like pigs to find a few roots; and as they can only find rotten ones, and not half enough of them, they become so weak that they have not strength left to seek food. The parish priest at Boult, whose letter we enclose, tells us he has buried three of his parishioners who died of hunger. The rest subsisted on chopped straw mixed with earth, of which they composed a food which cannot be called bread. Other persons in the same place lived on the bodies of animals which had died of disease, and which the curé, otherwise unable to help his people, allowed them to roast at the presbytery fire.

—John C. Calhoun, ""South Carolina Exposition and Protest,"" 1828
The argument put forth by John C. Calhoun in the passage above states a position in a debate that is most similar to which of the following debates from earlier in U.S. history?",The debate over whether to count slaves in the census for purposes of representation.,The debate over the Constitutionality of acquiring the Louisiana Purchase.,The debate over disestablishment of the Episcopal Church in several states.,The debate over replacing the Articles of Confederation with the Constitution.,D,"

John C. Calhoun`s argument is about the division of power between the General and State Governments. 

The debate over whether to count slaves in the census for purposes of representation is not related to the division of power between the General and State Governments. 

The debate over the Constitutionality of acquiring the Louisiana Purchase is not related to the division of power between the General and State Governments. 

The debate over disestablishment of the Episcopal Church in several states is not related to the division of power between the General and State Governments. 

The debate over replacing the Articles of Confederation with the Constitution is related to the division of power between the General and State Governments. 

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) The debate over replacing the Articles of Confederation with the Constitution.",D,high_school_us_history,R_brWrWFn81FXd3xf,rpp,AI chatbot,yes,712.0,"Business Administration, Political Economy",2178,,1,1,0,0,0.9090909090909091,History,Comfortable,1,0,0,1,2,"(25, 30]",-6659445599575723257,1,1.0,17.0,8.0,0.0,0.9090909090909091

When two charged particles are released from rest, they will experience a force due to the electric field. This force will cause them to accelerate. 

The direction of the force will depend on the sign of the charge of the particles.

First, we need to calculate the electric field at the point (0, 4 meters). This can be done using Coulomb`s law:

E = kQ/r^2

where k is the Coulomb constant, Q is the charge of the point charge, and r is the distance between the two charges.

Plugging in the values, we get:

E = (8.99 x 10^9 Nm^2/C^2)(1 mC)/(4 m)^2

E = 2.25 x 10^7 N/C

Now, we can calculate the work required to move the charge from (0, 4 meters) to (3 meters, 0). This can be done using the equation:

W = qE

where q is the charge of the particle being moved and E is the electric field.

Plugging in the values, we get:

W = (8 x 10^-6 C)(2.25 x 10^7 N/C)

W = 18 J

""You may well ask: ""Why direct action? Why sit-ins, marches and so forth? Isn`t negotiation a better path?"" You are quite right in calling, for negotiation. Indeed, this is the very purpose of direct action. Nonviolent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and foster such a tension that a community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue. It seeks so to dramatize the issue that it can no longer be ignored. My citing the creation of tension as part of the work of the nonviolent-resister may sound rather shocking. But I must confess that I am not afraid of the word ""tension."" I have earnestly opposed violent tension, but there is a type of constructive, nonviolent tension which is necessary for growth. Just as Socrates felt that it was necessary to create a tension in the mind so that individuals could rise from the bondage of myths and half-truths to the unfettered realm of creative analysis and objective appraisal, we must we see the need for nonviolent gadflies to create the kind of tension in society that will help men rise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism to the majestic heights of understanding and brotherhood.""

The purpose of NOW is to take action to bring women into full participation in the mainstream of American society now, exercising all the privileges and responsibilities thereof in truly equal partnership with men.
We believe the time has come to move beyond the abstract argument, discussion and symposia over the status and special nature of women which has raged in America in recent years; the time has come to confront, with concrete action, the conditions that now prevent women from enjoying the equality of opportunity and freedom of which is their right, as individual Americans, and as human beings.""

""The long-term goal of Gay Liberation, which inevitably brings us into conflict with the institutionalized sexism of this society, is to rid society of the gender-role system which is at the root of our oppression. This can only be achieved by eliminating the social pressures on men and women to conform to narrowly defined gender roles. It is particularly important that children and young people be encouraged to develop their own talents and interests and to express their own individuality rather than act out stereotyped parts alien to their nature.
As we cannot carry out this revolutionary change alone, and as the abolition of gender rotes is also a necessary condition of women`s liberation, we will work to form a strategic alliance with the women`s liberation movement, aiming to develop our ideas and our practice in close inter-relation. In order to build this alliance, the brothers in gay liberation will have to be prepared to sacrifice that degree of male chauvinism and male privilege that they still all possess.""

The Stamp Act says we shall have no commerce, make no exchange of property with each other, neither purchase nor grant, nor recover debts; we shall neither marry nor make our wills, unless we pay such and such sums; and thus it is intended to extort our money from us or ruin us by the consequence of refusing to pay it.""

Which author was most critical of the policy being described here by President Jackson?",Rachel Carson in Silent Spring.,Ralph Ellison in Invisible Man.,Helen Hunt Jackson in A Century of Dishonor.,William Lloyd Garrison in The Liberator.,C,"

The question is asking which author was most critical of the policy being described here by President Jackson. President Jackson is not mentioned in the passage, so we can eliminate this choice. 

The passage is discussing the Stamp Act of 1766, so the author must have been critical of this policy. 

The correct answer is (D) William Lloyd Garrison in The Liberator. Garrison was a prominent abolitionist who was highly critical of the Stamp Act and other policies that supported slavery.",D,high_school_us_history,R_3NTV82xOB5EmETf,rpp,AI chatbot,no,77.0,Economics,2595,"When i have problem with study, i will ask AI to explain it for me.",1,1,1,1,0.009708737864077652,History,Uncomfortable,-1,1,0,0,4,"(10, 15]",6002522125727404391,0,0.0,7.0,5.0,0.2647058823529412,0.27184466019417475

That day the Reverend Xuanzang was chosen from among all the monks. He had been a monk from infancy, and ever since birth he had eaten vegetarian food and observed the prohibitions. His maternal grandfather was an imperial commander, Yin Kaishan. His father Chen Guangrui had come top in the Palace Examination and had been appointed a grand secretary in the Imperial Library. Xuanzang, however, had no interest in honour and glory, and his only joy was to cultivate Nirvana. His virtue was great; of the thousand sutras and ten thousand holy books there was not a single one that he did not know.
…
He looked to the West and prayed, ""I am the believer Chen Xuanzang sent on imperial orders to fetch the scriptures. If I am fated to have a disciple, may I be able to unseal the golden words and release the divine Monkey King to come with me to the Vulture Peak. If I am not fated to have a disciple, and this monkey is an evil monster who has deceived me and will do me no good, then may I be unable to remove the seal."" When he had prayed he bowed again.

The revolutionary seed had penetrated into every country and spread more or less. It was greatly developed under the régime of the military despotism of Bonaparte. His conquests displaced a number of laws, institutions, and customs; broke through bonds sacred among all nations, strong enough to resist time itself; which is more than can be said of certain benefits conferred by these innovators.
The monarchs will fulfil the duties imposed upon them by Him who, by entrusting them with power, has charged them to watch over the maintenance of justice, and the rights of all, to avoid the paths of error, and tread firmly in the way of truth. Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.
Union between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .
Let them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.
Let them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.
Let them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.

Otto von Bismarck, 1884
Otto von Bismarck likely made this speech in reaction to which of the following issues?",Social acceptance of child labor,Declining life expectancy in Germany,Criticisms of German trade tariffs,Negative effects attributed to industrial capitalism,D,"

Otto von Bismarck was a German statesman who served as the first Chancellor of the German Empire from 1871 to 1890. He was known for his conservative policies, including the implementation of social welfare programs. 

The passage is discussing the plight of workers in the context of industrial capitalism. This suggests that the speech was likely made in reaction to the negative effects attributed to industrial capitalism.

""The spontaneous forces of capitalism have been steadily growing in the countryside in recent years, with new rich peasants springing up everywhere and many well-to-do middle peasants striving to become rich peasants. On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties. Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road. Can the worker-peasant alliance continue to stand in these circumstances? Obviously not! There is no solution to this problem except on a new basis. And that means to bring about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words, it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together. We maintain that this is the only way to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance.""

The Slave Trade
All of you [soldiers], are summoned . . . to hunt the idolatrous Koholanes [a pejorative word for ""black Africans""]. . . . The soldiery divided themselves into two companies . . . with orders to attack places without defenses and to carry off the inhabitants as well as seizing all peasants busy cultivating their fields. . . . Whilst waiting for the return of the companies despatched to hunt Negroes, we went every day to the slave market where we bought at the following prices:
A Negro with beard………………10 or 15,000 cowries.
They are not considered as merchandise since one has little chance of preventing them from escaping.
An adult Negress………………..10 or 15,000 cowries for the same reasons
An adolescent Negro………………….30,000 cowries
A young Negress ……………………50–60,000 cowries
The price varies according to whether she is more or less beautiful.
A male Negro child……………………..45,000 cowries
A female Negro child ……………………….35–40,000 cowries
Finally, our caravan which had set out from Algeria with sixty-four camels and only sixteen persons, was now augmented by four hundred slaves, of whom three hundred were women. . . . It was at this point that suddenly a confused noise of cries and sobs passed from one group of slaves to another and reached our own. . . . Some rolled on the ground, clung to bushes and absolutely refused to walk. . . . They could only be got up with mighty lashes of the whip and by rendering them completely bloody.

If it is fractured near the knee, we apply the ligature immediately above the fracture, and give the ends to an assistant, with which to make extension upwards; and while we put a ligature round the knee to secure it, and while the patient lies thus, with his leg extended, we arrange the fracture.""

""Medicine considers the human body as to the means by which it is cured and by which it is driven away from health. The knowledge of anything, since all things have causes, is not acquired or complete unless it is known by its causes. Therefore in medicine we ought to know the causes of sickness and health. And because health and sickness and their causes are sometimes manifest, and sometimes hidden and not to be comprehended except by the study of symptoms, we must also study the symptoms of health and disease. Now it is established in the sciences that no knowledge is acquired save through the study of its causes and beginnings, if it has had causes and beginnings; nor completed except by knowledge of its accidents and accompanying essentials.""

The presence of a general is necessary; he is the head, he is the all in all of an army. It was not the Roman army that conquered Gaul, it was Caesar, it was not the Carthaginians that made the armies of the Roman republic tremble at the very gates of Rome, it was Hannibal. (diary, 1801)

First, we need to figure out how much volume the Empire State Building has. We can estimate that each story is about 10 meters tall, so the total height of the building is about 1000 meters. We can also estimate that the building is about 50 meters wide and 50 meters long. That means the total volume of the building is about 25,000,000 cubic meters. 

Now, we need to figure out how much volume a single balloon can hold. We can estimate that a single balloon can hold about 0.1 cubic meters of air. 

Finally, we can calculate the total number of balloons required to fill the Empire State Building. We can do this by dividing the total volume of the building (25,000,000 cubic meters) by the volume of a single balloon (0.1 cubic meters). This gives us a total of 250,000,000 balloons.

The North Atlantic Treaty was signed by its participating countries in 1949. This was after World War II, so the opportunity to re-take colonies lost after World War II would not be a factor. 

The treaty itself outlines the purpose of the alliance, which is to settle international disputes peacefully, strengthen free institutions, eliminate conflict in international economic policies, and to provide mutual aid and assistance in the event of an armed attack.

In some States, a woman may testify against her husband, sue and be sued in the courts; in others, she has no redress in case of damage to person, property, or character. In case of divorce on account of adultery in the husband, the innocent wife is held to possess no right to children or property, unless by special decree of the court. But in no State of the Union has the wife the right to her own person, or to any part of the joint earnings of the co-partnership during the life of her husband. In some States women may enter the law schools and practice in the courts; in others they are forbidden. In some universities girls enjoy equal educational advantages with boys, while many of the proudest institutions in the land deny them admittance, though the sons of China, Japan and Africa are welcomed there. But the privileges already granted in the several States are by no means secure.""
Susan B. Anthony, ""Declaration of Rights for Women,"" July 4, 1876
The sentiments expressed in the second excerpt by Susan B. Anthony are most likely in support of",the Equal Rights Amendment,universal suffrage,states` rights,prohibition,B,"

The first excerpt is from Abigail Adams in 1776. She is advocating for more rights for women, and is suggesting that men should not have unlimited power over them. 

The second excerpt is from Susan B. Anthony in 1876. She is discussing the unequal rights of women in different states. 

Given this information, the most likely answer is (B) universal suffrage. Universal suffrage is the right for all citizens to vote, regardless of gender. This is the sentiment that Susan B. Anthony is expressing in her excerpt.",B,high_school_us_history,R_2txuYcn9S3aY0wM,rpp,expert,no,697.0,Mathematics,3690,"I worked with another student on a coding question from their homework for a CS class, and since we had heard of the new chatbot's capabilities, we wanted to put it to the test.

First, we need to calculate the concentration of the acid in the solution. We can do this by using the molar mass of the acid and the amount of acid that was dissolved in the solution. 

Molar mass of acid = 248 g/mol
Amount of acid = 0.0050 mol

Concentration of acid = 0.0050 mol/0.500 L = 0.01 mol/L

Now, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to calculate the pKa of the acid. 

pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])

3.89 = pKa + log(0.01/[HA])

pKa = 3.89 - log(0.01/[HA])

First, we need to determine the order of the reaction. To do this, we need to look at the equation and determine how many molecules of each reactant are involved in the reaction. In this case, we can see that two molecules of A and one molecule of B are involved in the reaction. Therefore, the reaction is second order with respect to A and first order with respect to B. 

Now, we can determine the rate law. The rate law is an equation that describes how the rate of a reaction is affected by the concentrations of the reactants. In this case, the rate law would be k[A]2[B], where k is the rate constant.

He knows that each student will need to use 0.797 grams of magnesium in the first step of the experiment and 0.892 grams in a later step. He uses front-end estimation with an adjustment to figure out the approximate amount of magnesium needed by each student. What is his estimate?,1.4 g,1.7 g,1.6 g,1.5 g,B,"

Dr. Sperline is using front-end estimation, which means he is rounding the numbers to the nearest whole number. So, 0.797 grams of magnesium becomes 1 gram and 0.892 grams of magnesium becomes 1 gram. 

Now, he needs to adjust his estimate to account for the difference between the rounded numbers and the actual numbers. In this case, the difference is 0.203 grams. 

So, the total amount of magnesium needed by each student is 1 + 1 + 0.203 = 2.203 grams.

Here is the case of a woman employed in the manufacturing department of a Broadway house. It stands for a hundred like her own. She averages three dollars a week. Pay is $1.50 for her room; for breakfast she has a cup of coffee; lunch she cannot afford. One meal a day is her allowance. This woman is young, she is pretty. She has ""the world before her."" Is it anything less than a miracle if she is guilty of nothing less than the ""early and improvident marriage,"" against which moralists exclaim as one of the prolific causes of the distresses of the poor? Almost any door might seem to offer a welcome escape from such slavery as this. ""I feel so much healthier since I got three square meals a day,"" said a lodger in one of the Girls` Homes. Two young sewing-girls came in seeking domestic service, so that they might get enough to eat. They had been only half-fed for some time, and starvation had driven them to the one door at which the pride of the American-born girl will not permit her to knock, though poverty be the price of her independence.

Jacob Riis is expressing a perspective of sympathy and understanding for the plight of the woman in the passage. He is also advocating for better working conditions and wages for the working poor. 

A supporter of Social Darwinism would not agree with this perspective, as they believe that the poor should be left to fend for themselves. 

A Progressive would agree with this perspective, as they advocate for better working conditions and wages for the working poor. 

A businessman would not agree with this perspective, as they would likely be opposed to increasing wages and improving working conditions.

George Washington expressed his opinion that the US needed a coercive power to ensure that people would carry out measures that were best for their own good. He also expressed his concern that people were speaking of a monarchical form of government without horror.

Apart from the desire to produce beautiful things, the leading passion of my life has been and is hatred of modern civilization. What shall I say of it now, when the words are put into my mouth, my hope of its destruction—what shall I say of its supplanting by Socialism?
What shall I say concerning its mastery of and its waste of mechanical power, its commonwealth so poor, its enemies of the commonwealth so rich, its stupendous organization—for the misery of life! Its contempt of simple pleasures which everyone could enjoy but for its folly? Its eyeless vulgarity which has destroyed art, the one certain solace of labor? All this I felt then as now, but I did not know why it was so. The hope of the past times was gone, the struggles of mankind for many ages had produced nothing but this sordid, aimless, ugly confusion; the immediate future seemed to me likely to intensify all the present evils by sweeping away the last survivals of the days before the dull squalor of civilization had settled down on the world.
This was a bad lookout indeed, and, if I may mention myself as a personality and not as a mere type, especially so to a man of my disposition, careless of metaphysics and religion, as well as of scientific analysis, but with a deep love of the earth and the life on it, and a passion for the history of the past of mankind.

The passage states that Morris had a ""deep love of the earth and the life on it, and a passion for the history of the past of mankind."" This suggests that Morris was interested in preserving the past and the natural world. 

The passage also states that Morris had a ""desire to produce beautiful things"" and a ""hatred of modern civilization."" This suggests that Morris was opposed to the current state of society and wanted to see it changed. 

The passage also states that Morris had a ""hope of its destruction"" and a ""hope of the past times."" This suggests that Morris wanted to see the current state of society replaced by something else.

The evolutionary theory is a scientific theory that explains the process of evolution, so it is not related to geological processes and natural laws. 

The law of superposition states that in an undeformed sequence of sedimentary rocks, each layer is older than the one above it and younger than the one below it. This is related to geological processes, but it does not state that geological processes and natural laws that operate now have operated in the past. 

The law of thermodynamics is a scientific law that states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, so it is not related to geological processes and natural laws. 

The principle of uniformitarianism states that geological processes and natural laws that operate now have operated in the past. This is the correct answer.

One of the rights which the freeman has always guarded with most jealous care is that of enjoying the rewards of his own industry. Realizing that the power to tax is the power to destroy and that the power to take a certain amount of property or of income is only another way of saying that for a certain proportion of his time a citizen must work for the government, the authority to impose a tax on the people has been most carefully guarded.… A government which lays taxes on the people not required by urgent necessity and sound public policy is not a protector of liberty, but an instrument of tyranny. It condemns the citizen to tyranny.

Glycaemic index (GI) is a measure of how quickly a food is broken down into glucose and absorbed into the bloodstream. Generally, foods with a lower GI are better for blood sugar control. 

A baked apple will have a higher GI than a raw apple, as baking breaks down the cell walls of the apple, making it easier to digest and absorb. 

A raw potato will have a higher GI than a raw apple, as potatoes are starchier and more complex than apples. 

Apple juice will have a higher GI than a raw apple, as the juice is more concentrated and easier to digest.

And they are not paid for the labor of traveling to and from the mines or for the time they spend at the mines. The Indians, under the pretext of mining chores, are made to spend their workdays herding cattle and conveying goods; they are sent off to the plains, and the Indians die.

And [the mine owners] keep Indian cooking women in their residences; they use cooking as a pretext for taking concubines….And they oblige the Indians to accept corn or meat or chicha [corn beer]…at their own expense, and they deduct the price from their labor and their workdays. In this way, the Indians end up very poor and deep in debt, and they have no way to pay their tribute.
There is no remedy for all this, because any [colonial official] who enters comes to an agreement with the mine owners, and all the owners join forces in bribing him….Even the protector of the Indians is useless;…he [does not] warn Your Majesty or your royal Audiencia [court] about the harms done to the poor Indians.""

The object is initially at rest, so it has a velocity of 0 m/s. 

The acceleration is given by a = (2 m/s^3)t for t ≥ 0. 

The object will travel for 3 seconds, so we can calculate the velocity at t = 3 seconds. 

The velocity at t = 3 seconds is given by v = (2 m/s^3) * 3 = 6 m/s. 

Now, we can calculate the distance traveled in 3 seconds.

""In 1500 that work appeared which Erasmus had written after his misfortune at Dover, and had dedicated to Mountjoy, the Adagiorum Collectanea. It was a collection of about eight hundred proverbial sayings drawn from the Latin authors of antiquity and elucidated for the use of those who aspired to write an elegant Latin style. In the dedication Erasmus pointed out the profit an author may derive, both in ornamenting his style and in strengthening his argumentation, from having at his disposal a good supply of sentences hallowed by their antiquity. He proposes to offer such a help to his readers. What he actually gave was much more. He familiarized a much wider circle than the earlier humanists had reached with the spirit of antiquity.
Until this time the humanists had, to some extent, monopolized the treasures of classic culture, in order to parade their knowledge of which the multitude remained destitute, and so to become strange prodigies of learning and elegance. With his irresistible need of teaching and his sincere love for humanity and its general culture, Erasmus introduced the classic spirit, in so far as it could be reflected in the soul of a sixteenth-century Christian, among the people. Not he alone; but none more extensively and more effectively. Not among all the people, it is true, for by writing in Latin he limited his direct influence to the educated classes, which in those days were the upper classes.
Erasmus made current the classic spirit. Humanism ceased to be the exclusive privilege of a few. According to Beatus Rhenanus he had been reproached by some humanists, when about to publish the Adagia, for divulging the mysteries of their craft. But he desired that the book of antiquity should be open to all.""
Johan Huizinga, twentieth-century Dutch philosopher, Erasmus and the Age of Reformation, 1924
Based on Huizinga`s description of Erasmus`s career, the contributions of Erasmus are most similar to those of",Johannes Gutenberg,Martin Luther,Francesco Petrarch,Christine de Pisan,C,"

Johannes Gutenberg is known for inventing the printing press, which allowed for the mass production of books. Erasmus did not invent the printing press. 

Martin Luther is known for his role in the Protestant Reformation. Erasmus was not a part of the Protestant Reformation. 

Francesco Petrarch is known for his role in the Italian Renaissance. Erasmus was not a part of the Italian Renaissance. 

Christine de Pisan is known for her role in the French Renaissance. Erasmus was not a part of the French Renaissance.

The right of judging, in such cases, is an essential attribute of sovereignty, of which the States cannot be divested without losing their sovereignty itself, and being reduced to a subordinate corporate condition. In fact, to divide power, and to give to one of the parties the exclusive right of judging of the portion allotted to each, is, in reality, not to divide it at all; and to reserve such exclusive right to the General Government (it matters not by what department to be exercised), is to convert it, in fact, into a great consolidated government, with unlimited powers, and to divest the States, in reality, of all their rights, It is impossible to understand the force of terms, and to deny so plain a conclusion.""

For the 176 players on the roster for one season of professional men`s basketball, the third quartile for the total number of offensive rebounds for one season was 143.

First, we need to calculate the probability that a single player had more than 143 offensive rebounds in one season. We can do this by dividing the number of players with more than 143 offensive rebounds (176 - 143 = 33) by the total number of players (176). This gives us a probability of 0.1875.

Next, we need to calculate the probability that at least three of the five players selected had more than 143 offensive rebounds. We can do this by using the binomial probability formula, which is P(X ≥ 3) = 1 - P(X ≤ 2).

Plugging in our values, we get P(X ≥ 3) = 1 - P(X ≤ 2) = 1 - (0.1875)^3 - 3(0.1875)^2(0.8125) - 3(0.1875)(0.8125)^2 - (0.8125)^3 = 0.8965.

I have, in conformity without resolve, put together some few points concerning the reformation of the Christian estate, with the intent of placing the same before the Christian nobility of the German nation. . . . It is not out of mere arrogance and perversity that I, an individual poor man, have taken upon me to address your lordships. The distress and misery that oppress all the Christian estates, more especially in Germany, have led not only myself, but every one else, to cry aloud and to ask for help. . . . These Romanists have, with great adroitness, drawn three walls around themselves, with which they have hitherto protected themselves, so that no one could reform them, whereby all Christendom has fallen terribly. . . . That the Temporal Power Has no Jurisdiction over the Spirituality . . . That No One May Interpret the Scriptures but the Pope . . . That No One May Call a Council but the Pope. . . . Let us now consider the matters which should be treated in the councils, and with which popes, cardinals, bishops, and all learned men should occupy themselves day and night. . . . It is a distressing and terrible thing to see that the head of Christendom, who boasts of being the vicar of Christ and the successor of St. Peter, lives in a worldly pomp that no king or emperor can equal. What is the use in Christendom of the people called ""cardinals""? I will tell you. In Italy and Germany there are many rich convents, endowments, fiefs, and benefices, and as the best way of getting these into the hands of Rome, they created cardinals, and gave them the sees, convents, and prelacies, and thus destroyed the service of God.

Next, we need to calculate the percentage of noise being blocked. To do this, we divide the difference (30 dB) by the original decibel level (140 dB): 30 dB / 140 dB = 0.214. 

Finally, we need to convert this decimal into a percentage. To do this, we multiply the decimal by 100: 0.214 x 100 = 21.40%.

The Begum Saheba and Mr. Hayat were permitted to see him after arrest.
He and I were going to address a meeting outside the station. He was arrested. I continued going to the meeting and addressed them. There is no cause for sorrow, but every cause for congratulation. There should be no hartal. Perfect peace and calmness should be observed. I regard the arrest as a prelude to Swaraj and the redress of the Khilafat and the Punjab wrongs, if we can remain non-violent. Retain Hindu-Muslim Unity despite the madness of some Moplahs, and fulfil the Swadeshi programme.
I hope every Indian, man or woman, will completely boycott foreign cloth and take up spinning or weaving during every spare minute.
By striving like the Maulana, be insistent on religious and national rights.
Let us earn imprisonment. I am conscious of the Maulana`s innocence and I am sure the imprisonment of the innocent will enable the nation to reach the cherished goal.""

As the native people survey bombed-out villages, women and children burned by napalm, rice crops destroyed and cities overrun with our military personnel, they are doubtless saying secretly of the Vietcong guerillas and of the American forces, ""A plague on both your houses."" … Stop the bombing, north and south, end search and destroy offensive sweeps, and confine our military action to holding operations on the ground. Bombing the north has failed to halt or seriously check the flow of troops to the south and may, in fact, have prompted a much greater war effort by Hanoi.
—Senator George McGovern, ""The Lessons of Vietnam,"" April 25, 1967
Which of the following opinions from the 1960s most directly reflects the perspective of George McGovern`s speech?",Americans must maximize their technological edge in Vietnam.,American bombing in Vietnam is step by step leading to progress in the war.,American bombing in Vietnam is a failure.,America must not give in to defeatism about the war in Vietnam.,C,"

McGovern`s speech is about stopping aggression from the north, but also about the failure of American bombing in Vietnam. He suggests that bombing the north has failed to halt or seriously check the flow of troops to the south and may, in fact, have prompted a much greater war effort by Hanoi. He also suggests that the American forces should confine their military action to holding operations on the ground. 

Therefore, the correct answer is C: American bombing in Vietnam is a failure.",C,high_school_us_history,R_3pi485iiZTomT3v,rpp,expert,yes,6214.0,"Political Science, Business Administration",2988,to help me come with transitions for an essay,1,1,1,1,0.0,History,Comfortable,1,0,0,1,4,"(10, 15]",1954562260106531436,1,1.0,7.0,3.0,1.0,1.0
